# THE UEMS AUTO POST CONFIGURATION FILE
# ==============================================================================================
#
# SO WHAT DOES THIS CONFIGURATION FILE DO FOR ME?
#
#   Below you will find parameters that control the post processing of output files concurrent
#   with a simulation.  This option is only available when running ems_autorun and is activated
#   by setting AUTOPOST in ems_autorun.conf.
#
# CAVEAT UTILITOR!
#
#   It is strongly suggested that you not initiate autopost on the same system being used to
#   run a simulation. In most cases, doing so will result in a degradation in performance for
#   both the simulation and post processor. If you are thinking about using the autopost option,
#   and I know you are, it is imperative that an alternate system be used for this task and
#   follow the steps below:
#
#      1. Find a Linux system with a minimum 8Gb of memory. The system should be running
#         an x64 Linux distribution similar to that on the primary (simulation) machine
#         to avoid headaches.
#
#      2. The UEMS must be available on the autopost machine and in the same directory path
#         as that on the primary system. The simplest way of doing this is to export the
#         UEMS partition to the autopost machine and create any necessary links.
#
#      3. You will also need to create a user on the autopost machine with the same name,
#         ID, and group, as that on the primary system. You can also export the user's
#         home directory to the autopost machine is you don't want to manage individual
#         home directories. The accounts must be the same for permission purposes and to
#         ensure all the environment variables are correctly set.
#
#      4. If you choose to create a separate home directory on the autopost machine, then
#         make sure the UEMS environment variable is correctly set in the user's .cshrc or
#         .bashrc file.
#
#      5. Configure passwordless SSH back and forth (primary <--> autopost) between the two
#         systems for the UEMS user. One-way (primary --> autopost) is not sufficient as the
#         autopost machine must monitor the simulation system to determine when the run has
#         completed.  You can test whether passwordless SSH is configured properly by using
#         the UEMS "cnet" utility:
#
#         From the primary (simulation) system:
#
#           %  $EMS/strc/UEMSbin/cnet --v <autopost hostname>
#
#         Followed by (again from the simulation machine):
#
#            %  ssh <autopost hostname>  $EMS/strc/UEMSbin/cnet --v <primary hostname>
#
#      6. If you are planning on exporting and of the post processed datasets such as GRIB,
#         GrADS, GEMPAK, BUFR, etc., via SCP (see post_exports.conf) then passwordless SSH
#         must also be configured between the autopost system and destination machine(s).
#
#   So, lets face it, you have a lot of work to do!
#
#   Should you experience any problems, the most likely cause is a firewall or SELinux
#   configuration. The recommended method of troubleshooting is to turn off both of these
#   services until you get AUTOPOST working, and then selectively turn them on again to
#   diagnose the problem.

#  AUTOPOST_WAIT
#
#    AUTOPOST_WAIT defines the amount of time, in seconds, to wait between attempts to
#    locate simulation output files to process. The value should be greater than the
#    amount of time between data dumps; however, it is not recommended that you try
#    to process every output file as they are available. There is no "rule-of-thumb"
#    for determining the value to use, just monitor the output frequency with your
#    runs and adjust the value accordingly.
#
#    New for UEMS V17:  The UEMS AutoPost routine will automatically adjust the value of
#    AUTOPOST_WAIT depending upon the amount of time required to process output files.
#    The value of AUTOPOST_WAIT will be increased slightly if the time to process data
#    files if less than 20% of AUTOPOST_WAIT.
#
#  DEFAULT: AUTOPOST_WAIT = 60
#
AUTOPOST_WAIT = 300


#  AUTOPOST_HOST
#
#    AUTOPOST_HOST specifies the hostname of the autopost system. When the AUTOPOST option
#    is initiated, a separate process is started on this machine. While the simulation is
#    running, autopost will look for data output to processes and then kick-off ems_post
#    if needed. Once autopost sees that the simulation has completed, it will run ems_post
#    a final time to make sure and  the data have been processed and then terminate. See
#    the guidance above for all the gory details.
#
#  DEFAULT: AUTOPOST_HOST = <blank>  (but you better provide a value)
#
AUTOPOST_HOST = 



#  AUTOUPP_NODECPUS
#
#    AUTOUPP_NODECPUS is a list of machines, processors, and IP addresses that define the
#    parallel computing configuration when running the EMSUPP routine to process model output
#    into GRIB 2 files. This parameter is nearly identical to EMSUPP_NODECPUS located in the
#    conf/ems_post/post_grib.conf file but is only used when processing simulation output
#    with the UEMS AutoPost option, and thus can differ from the EMSUPP_NODECPUS setting;
#    however, much of the guidance below is also provided in post_grib.conf.
#
#    AUTOUPP_NODECPUS has the following format:
#
#      AUTOUPP_NODECPUS = hostname1:NP:IP,hostname2:NP:IP,...,hostnameN:NP:IP
#    or
#      AUTOUPP_NODECPUS = NP        \
#    or                              These 2 are the same
#      AUTOUPP_NODECPUS = local:NP  /
#
#
#    Where "hostname" is the hostname of the system or node, "NP" is the number of processors
#    to use on that node, and "IP" is the IP address to use for communication to the other
#    nodes.
#
#    The hostname, number of processors, and IP address are separated by a colon (:) with
#    each system in the list separated by a comma (,).
#
#    Using a literal "local" refers to the machine on which ems_autopost is run, which is
#    specified by AUTOPOST_HOST above.
#
#    In the absence of either an IP address or hostname, the UEMS will attempt to resolve
#    the missing value through an often erroneous and convoluted sequence of system calls.
#    Despite of this approach, the method usually works well.
#
#    Important: On MULTI-HOMED systems that communicate over 2 or more subdomains, it is
#    critical that the IP address be specified for the private/isolated network!
#
#    Using either AUTOUPP_NODECPUS = NP  or AUTOUPP_NODECPUS = local:NP will result in post
#    processing being done on the local system ONLY, with the number of processors specified
#    by "NP".  In fact, including "local" anywhere in the list of machines will result in
#    the UEMS using ONLY the local system. All other hostnames are ignored.
#
#    REMEMBER: AUTOUPP_NODECPUS is used for running the UEMS UPP ONLY!  If left blank the
#              default is to use EMSUPP_NODECPUS from post_grib.conf, so make sure all
#              nodes are resolvable from AUTOPOST_HOST.
#
#    Also, be sure not to over-subscribe the AUTOPOST_HOST system (assign more CPUs than physically
#    available) as this will result in a degradation in performance. AND NO, YOU CAN NOT USE THE
#    VIRTUAL PROCESSORS THAT MAGICALLY APPEAR WHEN YOU TURN ON HYPER-THREADING, EVER! If you fail
#    to provide a value for AUTOUPP_NODECPUS then the UEMS will attempt to determine the number of
#    processors available by consulting the UEMS Ouija Board, and you know how well that works out.
#
#  DEFAULT: AUTOUPP_NODECPUS = <blank>  (Let the UEMS begin the seance)
#
AUTOUPP_NODECPUS = local:10



#  AUTOPOST_VERBOSE
#
#    Setting AUTOPOST_VERBOSE to a value other than 0 will turn on the writing of information to the
#    screen during the viability testing of the AUTOPOST_HOST. Unless you are having problems running
#    autopost, it is recommended that you keep AUTOPOST_VERBOSE = 0. Besides, the diagnostic information
#    printed to the screen is not formatted correctly, and I don't like that.
#
#  DEFAULT: AUTOPOST_VERBOSE = 0
#
AUTOPOST_VERBOSE = 0

# THE END OF THE UEMS AUTO POST CONFIGURATION FILE - WASN'T THAT FUN?
