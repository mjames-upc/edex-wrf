# THE UEMS GEMPAK POST PROCESSING CONFIGURATION FILE
# ==============================================================================================
#
#  SO WHAT DOES THIS CONFIGURATION FILE DO FOR ME?
#
#    Below you will find parameters that control the post-processing of simulation output
#    into exhilarating GEMPAK format. Please review and modify as necessary. .
#
#  THE GENERAL, YET IMPORTANT STUFF
#
#    The parameters contained in this file designated as "MAX DOMAINS" may include multiple
#    comma separated values to specify different settings for nested domains.
#
#      FREQ_WRF_GEMPAK = Primary Domain, Domain 2, Domain 3, ..., Domain N
#    Or
#      FREQ_WRF_GEMPAK = 180, 60, 15, 5
#
#    The domain number to process is specified by passing the "--domain #" flag to ems_post,
#    with the default being the primary domain (domain 1).
#
#    Failure to include a value below for a requested domain, E.g.,
#
#       FREQ_WRF_GEMPAK = 180, 60
#
#    when you are processing domain 3, ("--domain 3"), will result in the last value in
#    the parameter list being used (60), and you will like it.
#
#
#  THE MORE SPECIFIC BUT LESS IMPORTANT STUFF
#
#    *  You must either set GEMPAK = Y in post_uems.conf or pass the "--gempak" flag to ems_post
#       for any of the settings in this file to be used.  If GEMPAK = N and "--gempak" is not
#       passed, your effort here will be wasted.
#
#    *  All GRIB 2 files are created from the raw simulation output in netCDF format. Any
#       secondary file formats (GEMPAK, GrADS) are derived from the GRIB 2 files.
#
#    *  The default settings in this file should work for most applications and do not need
#       to be modified unless you are trying something fancy.
#
#  SOMETHING FAR LESS EXCITING
#
#    If you want to export any data types described in this file to exotic locations, then
#    please be sure to review the post_export.conf file before it is too late.

#  FREQ_WRF_GEMPAK & FREQ_AUX_GEMPAK (MAX DOMAINS)
#
#     The FREQ_WRF_GEMPAK and FREQ_AUX_GEMPAK parameters define the frequency, in minutes, of
#     the primary and auxiliary GRIB 2 files to process into GEMPAK format. Setting a value
#     to "Auto", "0", "1", or leaving it blank will result in all output times being processed.
#     The FREQ_AUX_GEMPAK parameter will be ignored if you are not processing auxiliary files.
#
#     As an example, if the period between GRIB 2 file times is 15 minutes, then setting
#     FREQ_WRF_GEMPAK or FREQ_AUX_GEMPAK to 30 (minutes) will result in every other GRIB 2 file
#     being processed, i.e., the 30, 60, 90, ..., minute files.
#
#     Remember that the period over which the precipitation bucket dump and max/min/mean fields
#     are valid is defined by the GRIB 2 files.
#
#     Recommendation: Save yourself the trouble and set FREQ_WRF|AUX_GEMPAK to 'Auto'.
#
#  DEFAULT: FREQ_WRF|AUX_GEMPAK = Auto
#
FREQ_WRF_GEMPAK = 1
FREQ_AUX_GEMPAK = 1



#  MONOFILE_GEMPAK
#
#     Setting MONOFILE_GEMPAK = Yes results in the GRIB 2 files being written to a single GEMPAK
#     file. The alternative is for each GRIB 2 file to be written to individual GEMPAK files.
#     Generally, you want MONOFILE_GEMPAK = Yes because doing so makes it easier to view time
#     sequences of your data.  The downside of this approach is that the GEMPAK files may become
#     very large.
#
#     Be Careful: The maximum number of grids in a gempak file is 59999. It is possible to exceed
#     this number if you are processing a large number of GRIB files containing many fields.
#
#  DEFAULT: MONOFILE_GEMPAK = Yes
#
MONOFILE_GEMPAK = Yes



#  FILENAME_GEMPAK
#
#     The FILENAME_GEMPAK parameters (not nested) define the naming convention for the final
#     GEMPAK files created from both the primary and auxiliary GRIB 2 files. When defining
#     the filename, placeholders should be used so that previously created files are not
#     accidentally over-written.
#
#     The list of available placeholders includes the following:
#
#         YYYY - 4-digit Year  (Initialization)
#         YY   - 2-digit Year  (Initialization)
#         MM   - 2-digit Month (Initialization)
#         DD   - 2-digit Day   (Initialization)
#         HH   - 2-digit Hour (24-hour clock) (Initialization)
#         MN   - 2-digit Minute (Initialization)
#         SS   - 2-digit Second (Initialization)
#         WD   - 2-digit domain number
#         CORE - 3-character core ID (currently arw only) - lower case
#         KEY  - The string that identifies the primary (wrfout) or auxiliary (auxhist) files
#
#     For the forecast time string:
#
#         FH    - 4-digit forecast hour (0 to forecast length - 0006, 0024, or 0144)
#         FX    - Auto-adjusted 2 to 4 digit forecast hour (0 to forecast length - 06 or 24)
#         FM    - 2-digit forecast minute (0 to 60)
#         FS    - 2-digit forecast second (0 to 60)
#      FCSTM    - Forecast time string formatted as HH[H[H]]:MM:SS
#
#     E.g., If processing auxiliary output data and FILENAME_GEMPAK = YYYYMMDDHHMN_CORE_KEY_dWD.gem,
#           then the final GEMPAK files will be named something like 201602311200_arw_auxhist1_d01.gem
#
#  NOTE: Like many things in the UEMS, the effects of changing the value of FILENAME_GEMPAK are not
#        known. Change at your own risk. And have a nice day!
#
#  DEFAULT: FILENAME_GEMPAK  = YYYYMMDDHHMN_CORE_KEY_dWD.gem
#
FILENAME_GEMPAK = YYYYMMDDHHMN_CORE_KEY_dWD.gem



#  POSTSCR_WRF_GEMPAK & POSTSCR_AUX_GEMPAK - CAVEAT UTILITOR!
#
#     The POSTSCR_* options allows you to further process the newly minted GEMPAK files into images
#     for display on the web. Unfortunately, this option is not as robust as it probably should be,
#     and thus, will require a bit of effort on your part. But hey, I brought you this far.
#
#     POSTSCR_WRF|AUX_GEMPAK defines the name and path of a script to be used to create the images.
#     The script will be run within the &Grib2Gempak routine located in the Ogempak.pm module.
#
#     The UEMS does provide a script that you can use for creating images. Note that this option
#     is not guaranteed to work all the time for everybody. It barely works for me, which means
#     you have no hope unless you are willing to do some heavy lifting.  The reason for these less
#     than confidence building words is that the lone UEMS developer doesn't have enough time to
#     ensure the routines are compatible with recent updates to GEMPAK.
#
#     IMPORTANT: If you actually do get something to work and want to include the GEMPAK
#                to gif file generation as part of your modeling dynasty, you may need to
#                have Xvfb running on your system. Contact me for details.
#
#     FINALLY:  If you want to export the newly-minted html and image files to some other
#               destination, and why wouldn't you, then YOU will have to add the necessary
#               code in these routines.
#
#               Sorry, but this step becomes too complex to generalize, and besides, I've
#               done enough for you already.
#
# POSTSCR_AUX_GEMPAK = /awips2/uems/util/nawips/ems/scripts/script_drvr.csh
# POSTSCR_WRF_GEMPAK = /awips2/uems/util/nawips/ems/scripts/script_drvr.csh
