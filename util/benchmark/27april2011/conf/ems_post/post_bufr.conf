# THE UEMS BUFR POST PROCESSING CONFIGURATION FILE
# ==============================================================================================
#
#  SO WHAT DOES THIS CONFIGURATION FILE DO FOR ME?
#
#    Below you will find parameters that control the post-processing of simulation output
#    into fabulous BUFR and secondary formats. Please review and modify as necessary. .
#
#  THE GENERAL, YET IMPORTANT STUFF
#
#    The parameters contained in this file designated as "MAX DOMAINS" may include multiple
#    comma separated values to specify different settings for nested domains.
#
#      FREQ_WRF_BUFR = Primary Domain, Domain 2, Domain 3, ..., Domain N
#    Or
#      FREQ_WRF_BUFR = 180, 60, 15, 5
#
#    The domain number to process is specified by passing the "--domain #" flag to ems_post,
#    with the default being the primary domain (domain 1).
#
#    Failure to include a value below for a requested domain, E.g.,
#
#       FREQ_WRF_BUFR = 180, 60
#
#    when you are processing domain 3, ("--domain 3"), will result in the last value in
#    the parameter list being used (60), and you will like it.
#
#
#  THE MORE SPECIFIC BUT LESS IMPORTANT STUFF
#
#    *  You must either set BUFR = Y in post_uems.conf or pass the "--bufr" flag to ems_post
#       for any of the settings in this file to be used.  If BUFR = N and "--bufr" is not
#       passed, your effort here will be wasted.
#
#    *  All BUFR files are created from the raw simulation output in netCDF format. Any
#       secondary file formats (BUFKIT, gempak soundings) are derived from the BUFR files.
#
#    *  The default settings in this file should work for most applications and do not need
#       to be modified unless you are trying something fancy.
#
#
#  SOMETHING FAR LESS EXCITING
#
#    If you want to export any data types described in this file to exotic locations, then
#    please be sure to review the post_export.conf file before it is too late.

#

#  FREQ_WRF_BUFR (MAX DOMAINS)
#
#     The FREQ_WRF_BUFR parameter defines the frequency, in minutes, of the primary (wrfout_*)
#     simulation output files to be processed  into BUFR format. Setting the value to "Auto",
#     "0", "1", or leaving it blank will result in all output times being processed.
#
#     As an example, if the period between simulation output times is 15 minutes, then setting
#     FREQ_WRF_BUFR to 30 (minutes) will result in every 2nd output time being processed,
#     i.e., the 30, 60, 90, ..., minute files.
#
#     Important, the parameter setting in this file are ignored unless BUFR = Y in post_uems.conf
#     or the --bufr or --bufkit flags are passed.
#
#  DEFAULT: FREQ_WRF_BUFR = Auto
#
FREQ_WRF_BUFR = Auto



#  FILENAME_BUFR
#
#     FILENAME_BUFR defines the body of the filename used for each BUFR file created.
#     The entire default naming convention is <FILENAME_BUFR>.STNID.YYYYMMDDCC, but
#     only the FILENAME_BUFR part can be controlled by the user.
#
#     When specifying FILENAME_BUFR, two placeholder strings, "WD" and "CORE", can be
#     included to represent the domain number and model core respectively. These
#     strings will be substituted with the actual values during processing.
#
#     The FILENAME_BUFR string will be converted to lower case during processing; however
#     the WD and CORE placeholders must be in specified as UPPER CASE.
#
#  DEFAULT: FILENAME_BUFR = emsbufr_CORE_dWD
#
FILENAME_BUFR = emsbufr_CORE_dWD



#  STATION_LIST  (MAX DOMAINS)
#
#     STATION_LIST is a comma separated list of fit files that contain the
#     locations if each BUFR file (stations) to create for each domain included in
#     the simulation. If only a single file is listed then it will be used for all
#     domains included in the BUFR processing. All station files must be located in
#     the static/ directory. If BUFR file processing is requested but the station
#     specified file is missing, the UEMS master (default) station file will be used.
#
#     Specifying individual station files domain may be done as as list:
#
#       STATION_LIST = uemsbufr_stations_d01.txt, uemsbufr_stations_d02.txt, ...,
#
#     or by using the "WD" placeholder where the "WD" will be replaced with the domain
#     number. For example:
#
#       STATION_LIST = uemsbufr_stations_dWD.txt
#
#     It's OK to have stations listed in the table that fall outside the areal coverage
#     of the domain being processed since they will just be ignored.
#
#     Should you accidentally delete or mangle a station file, simply copy the master
#     file, $UEMS/data/tables/post/bufr/uemsbufr_stations.MASTER, into your local
#     static/ directory and mangle it again as needed.
#
#     Feel free to edit/modify the station list as necessary. Remember that only sites
#     within your domain will be used. Entries are only necessary for the first seven
#     parameters. For example:
#
#          1     2  3    4  5  6   7  [For user information only]
#       725460 41.53N  93.65W KDSM 10  DES_MOINES_INTL         IA
#
#     The spacing of the fields in the file is important as the fortran read statement
#     used is FORMAT(I6,F6.2,A1,F7.2,A1,1X,A4,I3). Note that The Lat/Lon Directions ("N"
#     and "W" above) are important as is fields 7 ("10" above), which specifies the location
#     to be a land (10-19) or water (20-29) point. The "DES_MOINES_INTL         IA" is not
#     used by the code and serves as information for the user.
#
#     You may use any 6-digit station number and 4-character station ID as long as they are
#     unique to the station list.
#
#  DEFAULT: STATION_LIST = emsbufr_stations_dWD.txt
#
STATION_LIST = emsbufr_stations_dWD.txt



#  BUFR_INFO (MAX DOMAINS)
#
#     Set BUFR_INFO to "Yes" or "Y" if you want lots of interesting information written to
#     the BUFR log file. The downside is that this additional I|O will increase processing
#     time but may also enhance your social status as you will have plenty of fodder for
#     scintillating conversations with complete strangers at your bus stop.
#
#  DEFAULT: BUFR_INFO = N
#
BUFR_INFO = N

# BUFKIT AND GEMPAK SOUNDING CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================================================================
#

#  BUFKIT, APPEND_DATE & BUFR_STYLE (MAX DOMAINS)
#
#     Set BUFKIT = Y|Yes to create BUFKIT compatible data from the newly-minted BUFR files.
#     The naming convention used for the files is <YYMMDDHH>.<CORE>_<STID>.[buf|buz]
#     depending whether compressed (.buz) or ascii text (.buf) is requested.
#
#     Set ZIPIT to Yes if you like your BUFKIT files compressed (*.buz) rather than the
#     traditional ascii text (.buf) style. The compressed files (again, *.buz) are about
#     60% smaller in size, although you will not be able to easily open the files should
#     there be a problem. Note that *.buf files are pretty small anyway.
#
#     Set APPEND_DATE to Y|Yes if you want to append YYMMDDHH at the beginning bufkit file.
#     The YYMMDDHH represents the 2-digit year, month, day, and initialization hour of
#     the model run. Setting APPEND_DATE = No results in <CORE>_<STID>.[buf|buz] being used
#     for the file name.
#
#     Set BUFR_STYLE = 1 if you wish to create "Old School" style BUFKIT files containing
#     all the traditional (NCEP-style) fields such as soil moisture and surface fluxes.
#     Set BUFR_STYLE = 2 if you wish to create BUFKIT files containing fields such as
#     period accumulated Freezing Rainfall and Graupel, instantaneous and maximum
#     precipitation rates for various hydrometeor types, and lots of other cool stuff.
#
#     Note that these data may not be compatible with BUFKIT.
#
#  DEFAULTS:
#       BUFKIT      = No
#       ZIPIT       = 0
#       BUFR_STYLE  = 1
#       APPEND_DATE = Yes
#
BUFKIT = No
ZIPIT = 0
BUFR_STYLE = 1
APPEND_DATE = Yes



#  GEMSND and ASCISND (MAX DOMAINS)
#
#     Set GEMSND = Y|Yes if you want to create GEMPAK surface and sounding files from the
#     newly minted BUFR files. Note that GEMPAK sounding files are automatically created
#     as part of BUFKIT processing. Setting GEMSND = Y results in the files not being
#     deleted afterwards. Additionally, BUFKIT file processing does not need to be ON for
#     GEMPAK surface and sounding file creation.
#
#     Setting ASCISND = Y|Yes, results in an acsii file containing profile information on
#     model native model layers to be created. It's of limited value due to the lack of
#     precision in the field values but you might find it useful.  The naming convention
#     for these files is YYYYMMDDCC_ascisnd_CORE_dWD_STID.txt, which is hard coded in the
#     Perl module if you want to change it.
#
#  DEFAULTS:
#       GEMSND  = No
#       ASCISND = No
#
GEMSND = No
ASCISND = No
