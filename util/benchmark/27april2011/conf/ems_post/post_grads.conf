# THE UEMS GRADS POST PROCESSING CONFIGURATION FILE
# ==============================================================================================
#
#  SO WHAT DOES THIS CONFIGURATION FILE DO FOR ME?
#
#    Below you will find parameters that control the post-processing of simulation output
#    into intoxicating GrADS format. Please review and modify as necessary. .
#
#  THE GENERAL, YET IMPORTANT STUFF
#
#    The parameters contained in this file designated as "MAX DOMAINS" may include multiple
#    comma separated values to specify different settings for nested domains.
#
#      FREQ_WRF_GRADS = Primary Domain, Domain 2, Domain 3, ..., Domain N
#    Or
#      FREQ_WRF_GRADS = 180, 60, 15, 5
#
#    The domain number to process is specified by passing the "--domain #" flag to ems_post,
#    with the default being the primary domain (domain 1).
#
#    Failure to include a value below for a requested domain, E.g.,
#
#       FREQ_WRF_GRADS = 180, 60
#
#    when you are processing domain 3, ("--domain 3"), will result in the last value in
#    the parameter list being used (60), and you will like it.
#
#
#  THE MORE SPECIFIC BUT LESS IMPORTANT STUFF
#
#    *  You must either set GRADS = Y in post_uems.conf or pass the "--grads" flag to ems_post
#       for any of the settings in this file to be used.  If GRADS = N and "--grads" is not
#       passed, your effort here will be wasted.
#
#    *  All GRIB 2 files are created from the raw simulation output in netCDF format. Any
#       secondary file formats (GRADS, GrADS) are derived from the GRIB 2 files.
#
#    *  The default settings in this file should work for most applications and do not need
#       to be modified unless you are trying something fancy.
#
#
#  SOMETHING FAR LESS EXCITING
#
#    If you want to export any data types described in this file to exotic locations, then
#    please be sure to review the post_export.conf file before it is too late.

#  FREQ_WRF_GRADS & FREQ_AUX_GRADS (MAX DOMAINS)
#
#     The FREQ_WRF_GRADS and FREQ_AUX_GRADS parameters define the frequency, in minutes, of
#     the primary and auxiliary GRIB 2 files to process into GRADS format. Setting a value
#     to "Auto", "0", "1", or leaving it blank will result in all output times being processed.
#     The FREQ_AUX_GRADS parameter will be ignored if you are not processing auxiliary files.
#
#     As an example, if the period between GRIB 2 file times is 15 minutes, then setting
#     FREQ_WRF_GRADS or FREQ_AUX_GRADS to 30 (minutes) will result in every other GRIB 2 file
#     being processed, i.e., the 30, 60, 90, ..., minute files.
#
#     Remember that the period over which the precipitation bucket dump and max/min/mean fields
#     are valid is defined by the GRIB 2 files.
#
#     Recommendation: Save yourself the trouble and set FREQ_WRF|AUX_GRADS to 'Auto'.
#
#  DEFAULT: FREQ_WRF|AUX_GRADS = Auto
#
FREQ_WRF_GRADS = Auto
FREQ_AUX_GRADS = Auto


#  MONOFILE_GRADS
#
#     Setting MONOFILE_GRADS = Yes results in the GRIB 2 files being written to a single GrADS
#     file. The alternative is for each GRIB 2 file to be written to individual GRADS files.
#     Generally, you want MONOFILE_GRADS = Yes because doing so makes it easier to view time
#     sequences of your data. The downside of this approach is that the GRADS files may become
#     very large.
#
#  DEFAULT: MONOFILE_GRADS = Yes
#
MONOFILE_GRADS = Yes



#  POSTSCR_WRF_GRADS & POSTSCR_AUX_GRADS - CAVEAT UTILITOR!
#
#     The POSTSCR_* options allows you to further process the newly minted GrADS files into images
#     for display on the web. Unfortunately, this option is not as robust as it probably should be,
#     and thus, will require a bit of effort on your part. But hey, I brought you this far.
#
#     POSTSCR_WRF|AUX_GRADS defines the name and path of a script to be used to create the images.
#     The script will be run within the &GradsScript routine located in the Grads.pm module.
#
#     The UEMS does provide a script that you can use for creating images. Note that this option
#     is not guaranteed to work all the time for everybody. It barely works for me, which means
#     you have no hope unless you are willing to do some heavy lifting.  The reason for these less
#     than confidence building words is that the lone UEMS developer doesn't have enough time to
#     ensure the routines are compatible with recent updates to GrADS.
#
#     IMPORTANT: The image generation scripts included with the UEMS  only work with monolithic
#                (MONOFILE_GRADS = Y) GRADS files.
#
#     There are numerous GrADS scripts, collected from multiple sources, located in the
#     uems/util/grads/scripts directory. Most will require some modification and the creation of
#     a driver script that passes the proper arguments, but it's something for you to do.
#
#
#     GO'N KUMAR
#
#     The UEMS comes with a simple GrADS gif generation script that will create a web page with
#     animated gifs of your run. You can thank Kumar Vadlamani of NWS/CPC for this contribution
#     the next time you see him.
#
#     To run the script be setting POSTSCR_ to:
#
#         POSTSCR_(WRF|AUX)_GRADS = <path>/uems/util/grads/products/kumar/get_plots.tcsh
#
#
#     NOTE: With UEMS V18 the arguments passed to the image generation scripts have changed:
#
#             %  driver  gdir  cntrl  dnum
#
#           Where:
#
#             driver - The path/filename to the primary routine used for processing
#             gdir   - The path to the GrADS post processing directory
#             cntrl  - The filename of the GrADS control file
#             dnum   - The domain number to process
#
#           Additionally, the name of the sub-directory beneath <domain>/emsprd/grads
#           containing the web pages & images is now padded with a "0", i.e., d1htm -> d01htm
#
#           If you want to make a change, see the &GradsScript subroutine in strc/Upost/Grads.pm
#
#
#     FINALLY:  If you want to export the newly-minted html and image files to some other
#               destination, and why wouldn't you, then YOU will have to add the necessary
#               code in these routines.
#
#               Sorry, but this step becomes too complex to generalize, and besides, I've
#               done enough for you already.
#
# POSTSCR_AUX_GRADS = /awips2/uems/util/grads/products/kumar/plot_grads.tcsh
# POSTSCR_WRF_GRADS = /awips2/uems/util/grads/products/kumar/plot_grads.tcsh
