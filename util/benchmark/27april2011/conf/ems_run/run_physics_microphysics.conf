#  CONFIGURATION: MICROPHYSICS (MP_PHYSICS) PHYSICS CONFIGURATION
#
#  NOTE: Please read "run_physics_configuration.README" to learn how the configuration works
# ==============================================================================================
#
#    The MP_PHYSICS parameter specifies the microphysics (MP) scheme to use when running a
#    simulation. The microphysics provide the simulated heat and moisture tendencies,
#    distribution of hydrometeor species, microphysical rates, and surface precipitation
#    within a grid box.  If you are also using cumulus parameterization (CU_PHYSICS), then
#    the precipitation amounts simulated by the microphysics are in addition to those from
#    the cumulus scheme.
#
#    Recommendations in selecting an MP scheme from the WRF Workshop (Dudhia):
#
#    * Probably not necessary to use graupel schemes for DX > 10km since updrafts
#      producing the graupel are not resolved and less expensive schemes give similar
#      results.
#
#    * At high resolutions (DX < ~4km), where individual updrafts are reasonably well
#      resolved, a graupel scheme should be used.
#
#    * Note that while it is possible to specify different MP schemes for individual
#      nested domains, it is not recommended; thus, the initial value set for MP_PHYSICS
#      will be used for ALL domains.
#
#
#    The current MP_PHYSICS options include (NESTING):
#
#       0 - No Microphysics: Consequences unknown. May result in a mini black hole
#           and total annihilation the earth or worse. Use wisely.
