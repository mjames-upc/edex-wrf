# THE UEMS SIMULATION OUTPUT CONFIGURATION FILE
# ==============================================================================================
#
# SO WHAT DOES THIS CONFIGURATION FILE DO FOR ME?
#
#   Below you will find parameters that control the output of WRF primary
#   history (simulation) files. Please review and modify as necessary.
#
#   Parameter configuration descriptions below containing "NESTED" allow for the
#   inclusion of separate values for each LOCALIZED DOMAIN.
#
#   For Example:
#
#     SOME_PARM = Primary Domain, domain 2, domain 3, ..., domain N
#
#   The first value specified in the list will be applied to the primary domain with
#   each successive value assigned to the corresponding sub domain. All entries must
#   be separated by a comma (,). For example, let's say that you created and localized
#   file domains with Domain Wizard.  You could specify a different configuration
#   option for each domain (Don't try this at home - See potential fire hazard above):
#
#     SOME_PARM = 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0
#
#   If you include all five domains in your simulation, then the primary domain will
#   get a value of 5, domain two will get a value of 4, and finally domain five will
#   get assigned a value of 1.  The "0" at the end of the list will be ignored since
#   there are six values and only five domains.
#
#   Should you fail to include an entry for each domain fear not as the UEMS will use
#   the value of the PARENT domain.  The exception is for "HISTORY_INTERVAL" or
#   similar fields, in which case SOME_PARM(domain) = f(DX(domain)).
#
#   Note: This file only contains the configuration options for the primary history
#         files.  Configuration for output of the auxiliary history files can be
#         found in the "run_auxhist1.conf" files.

#

#  OPTION:  HISTORY_INTERVAL (NESTED)
#
#     HISTORY_INTERVAL specifies the frequency, in minutes, of model simulation
#     output for each domain. For example, HISTORY_INTERVAL = 60, is hourly;
#     HISTORY_INTERVAL = 30 is every 30 minutes.
#
#     HISTORY_INTERVAL = 180,60 is 3-hourly for the primary domain and hourly
#     for the first nested domain.
#
#  DEFAULT:  HISTORY_INTERVAL = 60,30
#
HISTORY_INTERVAL = 180, 60, 30


#  OPTION:  FRAMES_PER_OUTFILE - Just what it says
#
#    FRAMES_PER_OUTFILE (NESTED) is the number of output times to write to
#    each forecast file.  Typically, a user would want FRAMES_PER_OUTFILE = 1,
#    which is one forecast time per file, or FRAMES_PER_OUTFILE > = total number
#    of output times, if the user wants all times written to a single monolithic
#    file.  You could also do something in between if your heart desires, but
#    there are more desirable things in this world than causing yourself pain
#    when the ems_post fails because you chose something other than 1 frame
#    per output file. Just don't do it.
#
#  DEFAULT: Use FRAMES_PER_OUTFILE = 1
#
FRAMES_PER_OUTFILE = 1


#  OPTION:  ADJUST_OUTPUT_TIMES - adjust output files to output frequency
#
#  VALUES:
#
#      F - Do not adjust the time stamp in the output files
#      T - Adjust the time stamp in the output files
#
#  NOTES:   The ADJUST_OUTPUT_TIMES parameter will automatically adjust the time
#           stamp in the output files to match the specified output frequency for
#           each domain and file type. Most users want this value set to 1 (Yes);
#           otherwise you may get file output times that are a few seconds from the
#           expected output time, which can cause problems during post processing.
#
#  DEFAULT: ADJUST_OUTPUT_TIMES = T
#
ADJUST_OUTPUT_TIMES = T


#  OPTION:  IOFIELDS_FILENAME - list of filesnames used to override registry IO
#
#  VALUES:  The IOFIELDS_FILENAME parameter is a list of filenames in quotes, separated
#           by a comma, that contain modifications to the registry data stream. Files
#           must be located in the <domain>/static directory.
#
#           This option will be turned OFF if IOFIELDS_FILENAME is blank.
#
#  NOTES:   If you use this option then make sure you follow the guidelines provided
#           in the official WRF user's guide. The files must have a naming convention
#           of "iofields_d<domain>.txt", i.e.,
#
#           IOFIELDS_FILENAME = iofields_d01.txt,iofields_d02.txt,...,iofields_d0N.txt
#
#           otherwise the UEMS will "accidentally" delete the files from the directory
#           during one of it's many cleaning efforts.
#
#           Actually, any files with the name "iofields_*" will be preserved.
#
#  DEFAULT: IOFIELDS_FILENAME = (blank)
#
IOFIELDS_FILENAME =

#  ANCILLARY CONFIGURATION SETTINGS YOU PROBABLY DO NOT NEED TO WORRY ABOUT
# ==============================================================================================
#

#  OPTION:  USE_NETCDF_CLASSIC
#
#  VALUES:  T - Use netCDF classic version 3 (Default)
#           F - Use netCDF-4 with HDF5
#
#  NOTES:   The USE_NETCDF_CLASSIC parameter controls whether the format of the
#           simulation output is in netCDF "classic" (netCDF-3) or netCDF-4 (HDF5)
#           format.  Until netCDF-4 becomes more "common" (netCDF humor) it is
#           recommended that you set USE_NETCDF_CLASSIC = T and go about your
#           business, because netCDF-4 is not yet supported by the UEMS. Like so
#           many other things, maybe someday.
#
#
#  DEFAULT: USE_NETCDF_CLASSIC = 'T'
#
USE_NETCDF_CLASSIC = T



#  OPTION:  HISTORY_NAMEKEY - Primary WRF output filename key
#
#  VALUES:  The HISTORY_NAMEKEY parameter is a string that will be used to complete
#           the naming convention for the primary WRF fields.  All files will use a
#           convention of "<namekey>_d<domain>_<date>" where "<namekey>" is replaced
#           by the default or a user-specified string defined by HISTORY_NAMEKEY.
#
#  NOTES:   Stick with the default and we'll all be happier for it.
#
#  DEFAULT: HISTORY_NAMEKEY = wrfout
#
HISTORY_NAMEKEY = wrfout



# WRF Model Debug output level - Just because I have no better place to put this
#
#   Increasing the value of DEBUG_LEVEL above 0 will increase the verbosity level
#   for information being dumped out to the log file. Values from 0 to just less than
#   infinity are allowed; however, there is not much difference between infinity-1
#   and infinity-2. You should only set DEBUG_LEVEL > 1 if you are having problems
#   with the model as the additional I/O will slow your run.
#
DEBUG_LEVEL = 0



# WRF Model Logging - Stuff that may be useful at some point, or may not
#
#    LOGGING controls the information written to the RSL standard error files.
#    For the most part this information is already captured in the RSL out
#    files and tends to slow down the simulation.  Information regarding
#    error logging is buried deep within the bowels of the model code so
#    you will have to do some digging should you really be interested, which
#    you are not.
#
#      LOGGING = 1  turns  ON  IO to rsl.error.* files
#      LOGGING = 0  turns  OFF IO to rsl.error.* files (Default)
#
LOGGING = F
