#  THE WRF PHYSICS SUITE CONFIGURATION FILE
# ==============================================================================================
#
# IMPORTANT USER INFORMATION - Read on if you dare
#
#   Tired of jumping from configuration file to configuration file each time you want to
#   change a bunch of physics settings for your simulation?  Sure, we all are!
#
#   Now the WRF (and thus UEMS) includes the "PHYSICS SUITE" option, which allows you
#   to specify a set of physics configuration settings with a single parameter below.
#   This option differs slightly from the official WRF release version in that besides
#   the suite options offered by WRF, the UEMS allows you to define your own physics
#   suite.  Pretty "sweet" hey.
#
#   The PHYSICS_SUITE configuration is slightly different in the UEMS compared to WRF in
#   that the WRF "physics_suite" namelist option is never used. If the PHYSICS_SUITE
#   parameter below is set to one of the "suites" defined at the bottom of this file,
#   the associated parameters will be used to replace those specified in the various
#   run_physics_<area>.conf files. All the same UEMS parameter rules apply, so if you
#   include any sub-domains in your simulation and want to change physics schemes
#   between a parent and child, then that information must be included in the
#   "SUITE_NAME = PARAMETER:VAL,VAL,...,VAL" configuration below.
#
#   Finally, as always, some of the information provided below was freely "liberated" from
#   various sources including the WRF user's guide, tutorials, and on-line training. Thus,
#   the original authors should receive credit for any moments of clarity you experience
#   while reading this file.

#  OPTION: PHYSICS_SUITE (NEW) - Use a predefined set of physics configuration values
#
#     Use the PHYSICS_SUITE parameter if you want to set the configuration for a
#     simulation to a predefined set of values rather then specifying them individually
#     in each of the run_physics_<area>.conf file. The choice of official WRF suites
#     is currently limited to:
#
#       PHYSICS_SUITE = CONUS
#
#         MP_PHYSICS         = 8   New Thompson graupel scheme
#         CU_PHYSICS         = 6   Modified Tiedtke scheme
#         RA_LW_PHYSICS      = 4   RRTMG scheme
#         RA_SW_PHYSICS      = 4   RRTMG scheme
#         BL_PBL_PHYSICS     = 2   Mellor-Yamada-Janjic scheme
#         SF_SFCLAY_PHYSICS  = 2   MYJ Monin-Obukhov similarity theory
#         SF_SURFACE_PHYSICS = 2   Unified Noah LSM
#
#
#       PHYSICS_SUITE = TROPICAL
#
#         MP_PHYSICS         = 6   WSM Single-Moment 6-class scheme
#         CU_PHYSICS         = 16  A newer Tiedtke scheme
#         RA_LW_PHYSICS      = 4   RRTMG scheme
#         RA_SW_PHYSICS      = 4   RRTMG scheme
#         BL_PBL_PHYSICS     = 1   Yonsei University scheme
#         SF_SFCLAY_PHYSICS  = 91
#         SF_SURFACE_PHYSICS = 2   Unified Noah LSM
#
#
#       PHYSICS_SUITE = HRRR*
#
#         MP_PHYSICS         = 28    Thompson Aerosol Aware scheme
#         CU_PHYSICS         = 0     None
#         RA_LW_PHYSICS      = 4     RRTMG scheme
#         RA_SW_PHYSICS      = 4     RRTMG scheme
#         BL_PBL_PHYSICS     = 5     Mellor-Yamada Nakanishi Niino (MYNN2)
#         SF_SFCLAY_PHYSICS  = 5     MYNN Monin-Obukhov similarity theory
#         SF_SURFACE_PHYSICS = 3     RUC LSM
#
#         * Just the basic HRRR physics configuration - The full HRRR experience can be found
#           by setting:

#           in the run_namelist.conf

#
#   Below is where the suite magic happens, or at least where the various physics suites are
#   defined. If the PHYSICS_SUITE parameter is defined above, the UEMS will attempt to match
#   the moniker with the specified set of parameter:values below.  This approach allow users
#   to create (and share) their own physics suites simply by defining a new one below. Each
#   physics suite option has the format of "SUITE_NAME = PARAMETER:VAL,VAL,...,VAL",
#   where "NAME" is the name of the suite specified PHYSICS_SUITE = <NAME> above. PARAMETER
#   is the physics namelist parameter to use for the configuration and "VAL,VAL,...,VAL"
#   contains the comma separated list of values for that parameter. Note that all the
#   normal configuration rules apply, so you are encouraged to read the individual config
#   files before making your final suites.
