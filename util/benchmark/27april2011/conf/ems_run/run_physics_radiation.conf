#
#   LONGWAVE RADIATION SCHEMES (RA_LW_PHYSICS)
#
#    The RA_LW_PHYSICS parameter defined the longwave radiation scheme used in your simulation.
#    It is used to compute clear-sky and cloudy upward & downward long-wave radiation fluxes.
#
#
#    Excited yet? You should be. The current RA_LW_PHYSICS options include (NESTING):
#
#       0 - No long wave radiation scheme
#
#       1 - RRTM scheme: Rapid Radiative Transfer Model. An accurate spectral scheme
#           using look-up tables for efficiency. Accounts for multiple bands, trace
#           gases, and microphysics species. Interacts with clouds.  For trace gases,
#           the volume-mixing ratio values for CO2 = 379e-6, N2O = 319e-9 and CH4 = 1774e-9,
#           which are updated from pre-V3.5 values (CO2 = 330e-6, N2O = 0. and CH4 = 0).
#           (Mlawer et al 1997).
#
#       3 - CAM3 Longwave Radiation Scheme (ARW only): A spectral scheme with 8 long-wave
#           bands. Scheme allows for interactions with clouds (RH-based cloud fraction
#           when RH < 1), trace gasses, and aerosols. Ozone profile is a function
#           of the month and latitude only). It uses yearly CO2, and constant N2O (311e-9)
#           and CH4 (1714e-9).
#
#       4 - RRTMG scheme (ARW only): Rapid Radiative Transfer Model with a G at the end.
#           An updated version of the RRTM scheme including MCICA method of random cloud
#           overlap. Uses 16 long-wave Bands (K-distribution), look-up tables fit to
#           accurate calculations, cloud, trace gas and aerosol interactions. Ozone and
#           CO2 profiles are specified (CO2 = 379e-6, N2O = 319e-9, CH4 = 1774e-9).
#
#           Notes: The  default ozone used in the scheme only varies with height. To use
#                  use the CAM ozone dataset, use O3INPUT = 2 (Below)
#
#                  The default is for the aerosol option to be turned OFF AER_OPT = 0
#
#
#       5 - New Goddard (GFDL) scheme: Efficient, multiple bands, ozone from climatology.
#           It uses constant CO2 = 337e-6, N2O = 320e-9, CH4 = 1790e-9.
#
#       7 - Fu-Liou-Gu scheme (UCLA):  Multiple bands, cloud and cloud fraction effects,
#           ozone profile from climatology (CO2 = 345e-6).
#
#      24 - Super faster RRTMG scheme (ARW only): A faster, sexier version of the Rapid
#           Radiative Transfer Model with a G at the end. It's just like option 4, only
#           faster, and possibly a bit shinier. And who doesn't want that?
#
#           See option 4 above for more details.
#
#
#    LONGWAVE NOTES:
#
#          1. The UEMS WRF binaries were compiled with the CAM Green House Gases option,
#             meaning that the CAM, RRTM and RRTMG long-wave schemes will see the yearly
#             green house gases from 1765 to 2500. Five scenario files are available,
#             CAMtr_volume_mixing_ratio.RCP4.5, CAMtr_volume_mixing_ratio.RCP6,
#             CAMtr_volume_mixing_ratio.RCP8.5, CAMtr_volume_mixing_ratio.A1B, and
#             CAMtr_volume_mixing_ratio.A2. The default points to the RCP8.5 file in
#             <uems>/data/tables/wrf/physics/radn
#
#
#   SHORTWAVE RADIATION SCHEMES (RA_SW_PHYSICS)
#
#    The RA_SW_PHYSICS parameter defined the shortwave radiation scheme used in your simulation.
#    It is used to compute clear-sky and cloudy solar (shortwave) fluxes and includes annual
#    and diurnal solar cycles - "If this don't make your booty move, your booty must be dead".
#
#
#       0 - No short wave radiation scheme (Sun burns up - I heard it could happen).
#
#
#       1 - Dudhia scheme: Simple downward integration allowing efficiently for clouds
#           and clear-sky absorption and scattering. Does not account for aerosols and
#           is tuned for Kansas so locations with more pollution (air) may see a
#           positive bias in the downward surface fluxes (dudhia 1989).

#
#
#       2 - Goddard (GFDL) shortwave: Two-stream multi-band (8) scheme with ozone from
#           climatology and cloud effects. Increases computational time (3x) at radiation
#           call times (RADT) but not during between times. Ozone profile is function
#           season and region (tropics, mid-latitude, polar). Fixed CO2. (Chou and Suarez 1994).

#  ANCILLARY RADIATION PHYSICS CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
#
#  NOTE - Some of the more esoteric radiation scheme namelist parameters are set
#         internally by the UEMS simply to save space in this file.  You really
#         don't want or need to know what you are missing.

#

#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  General RA_LW|SW_PHYSICS Physics Options (Available for all)
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#

#  OPTION:  RADT - Radiation scheme call frequency
#
#  NOTES:   RADT is the number of minutes between calls to the long and short wave
#           radiation schemes. This value should decrease with smaller grid spacing;
#           however, for 2-way nested domains, a single value based on the DX of the
#           domain with the smallest DX should be used for all domains. In fact, it
#           is recommended that you always use the same value for all domains unless
#           you have a good reason not to follow directions, which you don't.
#
#           According to the WRF FAQ page:
#
#               "This value (RADT) should coincide with the finest domain resolution
#                (1 minute per km dx), but it usually is not necessary to go below 5
#                minutes All domains should use the same value, so that radiation
#                forcing is applied at the same time for all domains."
#
#           For example, if you are running a 27/9/3km nested domain configuration then
#           the value for RADT for all domains will be determined from the 3km DX value,
#           which is three minutes. Some refinement may be done so that the value is
#           an integer multiple of the number of timesteps, but all that magic occurs
#           behind the curtain.
#
#           If you are using a scheme other than Dudia, such as Goddard, then you may
#           be able to get away with a RADT greater than DX value (again ignore the units).
#
#
#           Possible values for RADT include:
#
#              1. A single value to represent the number of minutes between calls to
#                 radiation schemes. This value will be used for all domains included
#                 in the simulation.
#
#              2. Multiple numbers, separated by a comma (,) that represent the number
#                 of minutes between calls to radiation schemes for each domain used
#                 in the simulation.
#
#              Info for options 1 and 2 - The UEMS will not (usually) alter your value
#                   for RADT, but the WRF may adjust values to coincide with the
#                   simulation time step.
#
#
#              3. Use one of the predefined UEMS configuration options. All calculations
#                 are based upon the grid spacing of domains included in the simulation
#                 with a possible slight adjustment so that RADT is an integer multiple
#                 of the large timestep. If an adaptive timestep is used, then no
#                 adjustments are made. The options include:
#
#                   Auto   - Use a value for RADT based on the DX of each domain
#                   Auto_1 - Use the value calculated for the primary domain for all sub-domains
#                   Auto_2 - Use the value calculated for domain with the smallest DX for all domains
#
#                            If the calculated RADT value is smaller than the simulation large time-
#                            step (very possible), the time step value will be used for RADT.
#
#                 !  There is no 5km/5min lower limit with the "Auto" option (1 minute minimum).
#
#
#  DEFAULT: RADT = Auto_2 - Each domain the same value based upon smallest DX.
#
RADT = Auto_2


#   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   NOTE - SLOPE_RAD and TOPO_SHADING should only be used when the grid spacing is
#          less than a few kilometers. The UEMS will automatically turn them off
#          unless DX < 5km, but they will NOT automatically be turned ON if
#          DX < 5km. That is your job. A
#
#          If you want to be all lazy about it then just turn the parameter ON for
#          the primary domain regardless whether it's greater than the minimum 5km
#          and the UEMS will turn ON those domains with a DX less than or equal to
#          5km and the others (> 5km DX) OFF.
#

#  OPTION:  SLOPE_RAD - Modify surface solar radiation flux according to terrain slope

#
#  NOTES:   Only necessary when grid spacing is a few kilometers or less
#
#  DEFAULT: SLOPE_RAD = 0
#
SLOPE_RAD = 0


#  OPTION:  TOPO_SHADING - Allows for shadowing of neighboring grid cells
#
#  VALUES: (MAX DOMAINS)
#
#       0 - Do not include topography shading (OFF)

#  OPTION:  SHADLEN -  Max orographic shadow length in meters when TOPO_SHADING = 1
#
#  VALUES: (MAX DOMAINS)
#
#  NOTES:   The default is 25000 meters (25km), which probably is OK
#
#  DEFAULT: SHADLEN = 25000
#
SHADLEN = 25000


#  OPTION:  SWINT_OPT - Interpolate SW Radn based on updated zenith angle between calls
#
#  VALUES:
#
#       0 - Do not update between calls (Previous method)

#
#  DEFAULT: SWINT_OPT = 1
#

#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Only used with Dudhia Short wave radiation (RA_SW_PHYSICS = 1) Option
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  OPTION:  SWRAD_SCAT - Clear-sky shortwave scattering tuning parameter
#
#  NOTES:   Default value of 1., which is equivalent to  is 1.e-5 m2/kg
#           Actual value used is SWRAD_SCAT * 1.e-5 m2/kg in the code,
#           which approximates the value over Kansas.
#
#  DEFAULT: SWRAD_SCAT = 1
#
SWRAD_SCAT = 1


#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Used with RA_LW_PHYSICS = 1, 4, or 24 and RA_SW_PHYSICS = 1, 4, or 24 (RRTM & RRTMG schemes)
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  OPTION:  ICLOUD - Cloud fraction and the effect to the optical depth in radiation
#
#  VALUES:

#           optical depth in shortwave radiation scheme (1 or 4)
#       1 - With fractional cloud effects Xu-Randall cloud fraction (0 to 1)
#       2 - Use threshold method which gives either 0 or 1 as cloud fraction (Not supported)
#       3 - RH-based method that follows Sundqvist et al. (1989). The threshold of RH depends on grid sizes.
#
#  NOTES:
#        *  Functionality of this option changed with V3.7
#
#        *  If CU_PHYSICS = 11, ICLOUD will automatically be set to 1 regardless
#           of RA_LW_PHYSICS and RA_SW_PHYSICS values.
#
#        *  Option ICLOUD = 2 is no longer supported  in the UEMS because of problems
#           handling the binary (1|0) values in the post processor. As Bob Ross might
#           have said: "Do you want pretty clouds? Then choose another option!"
#
#        *  ICLOUD = 3 can not be used with the Kessler or WSM3 MP schemes - will

#  NOTES:   The Tegan climatology dataset (AER_OPT = 1) has 6 types: organic carbon,
#           black carbon, sulfate, sea salt, dust and stratospheric aerosol (volcanic
#           ash, which is zero). The data also has spatial (5 degrees in longitude and
#           4 degrees in latitudes) and temporal (monthly) variations.
#
#           The J. A. Ruiz-Arias method (AER_OPT = 2)  requires further configuration
#           of the various AER_* options below. It also works with the new Goddard
#           radiation schemes (RA_LW|SW_PHYSICS = 5), although the heading above does
#           not reflect that fact.
#
#           The Climatological water and ice-friendly aerosols option (3) is only for
#           use with the Thompson (mp_physics=28) MP scheme. If using the Thompson
#           aerosol aware MP scheme then AER_OPT will be set to 3 for a non-zero value
#           below. If not using the Thompson aerosol aware MP scheme and AER_OPT = 3
