# THE WRF LIGHTNING PARAMETERIZATION CONFIGURATION FILE
# ==============================================================================================
#
# IMPORTANT USER INFORMATION - Read on if you dare
#
#   This file contains the configuration parameters for the WRF lightning scheme.
#   The scheme is based on the Price and Rind (PR) lightning parameterization
#   that was originally included in WRF-Chem and then adapted for the ARW core.
#   It is primarily intended for predicting flash rates in simulations that
#   partially resolve convection (With CU scheme) although there is an option
#   for running without cumulus parameterization (MP Only).
#
#   While this option may seem really, really cool, it is important to understand
#   its limitations, of which there are many. It is not recommended that you use
#   this scheme as a predictive tool in real-time forecasting applications, simply
#   because proper tuning requires an understanding of the interaction between
#   the lightning and other the physics schemes, some of which is case dependent.
#
#   Also, a few of the configuration parameters listed in the WRF documentation
#   have been removed from your control. This was done to simplify the logic
#   within the UEMS routines and because there is no good reason for you to
#   deviate from the defaults.
#
#   If you are interested in using the lightning parameterization then you are
#   strongly encouraged to read the paper by J. Wong et. al. (2013), which can
#   be found at docs/wrf/Wong_LightningEvaluation_2013.pdf
#
#   Go ahead and read it - Like now. I'll still be here when you return.

#  Available for everybody and anybody, and you too
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  OPTION:  LIGHTNING_OPTION = (0, 1, 2, 3, or 11)
#
#     The lightning_option parameter controls which variation of the PR scheme
#     to use. Possible values are:
#
#        0   -   The lightning parameterization scheme is OFF (default).
#
#        1   -   PR92 based on maximum w,  redistributes flashes within dBZ > 20 (MP only runs)
#
#        2   -   PR92 based on 20 dBZ top, redistributes flashes within dBZ > 20 (MP only runs)
#
#        3   -   Lightning Potential Index (LPI) (based on Yair et. al. 2010)
#                Additional Info: http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/WAF-D-11-00144.1
#
#       11   -   PR92 based on level of neutral buoyancy from convective parameterization
#                (Use CU_PHYSICS = 3, 5 or 93) intended for use at 10 < dx < 50 km;
#
#     You may use a different configuration for each domain in your simulation (MAX DOMAINS),
#     but I wouldn't do it.
#
#     Note that for options 1 & 2 are designed for running without a CU scheme so you
#     need to have CU_PHYSICS = 0 for those domains. Also, LIGHTNING_OPTION = 11 is
#     designed for use with a Grell CU scheme (CU_PHYSICS = 3, 5, or 93). Any attempt
#     to deviate from these directives shall be dealt with severely, like by issuing
#     a kindly worded reminder followed by an override of your futile configuration
#     attempt. You've been warned.
#
#     If you are running a nested simulation in which CU_PHYSICS is turned ON for an
#     outer domain and then turned OFF (CU_PHYSICS = 0) for a child, then the value
#     for LIGHTNING_OPTION will be applied only to those domains with CU OFF unless
#     you are using LIGHTNING_OPTION = 11 with Grell.
#
#     HEY YOU, READ THIS:
#
#     Most users will want to to use option 3, which requires use of an MP scheme that
#     includes graupel. If LIGHTNING_OPTION = 3 and you are not using a graupel scheme
#     the UEMS will turn OFF the lightning option.
#
#  DEFAULT: LIGHTNING_OPTION = 3
#
LIGHTNING_OPTION = 0


#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE FOR LIGHTNING_OPTION = 1,2, & 11,
#  WHICH MEANS IF YOU ARE RUNNING LIGHTNING_OPTION = 3 (LPI), YOU DON'T
#  NEED NO STINKING OPTIONS - And that's a good thing!
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#

#  OPTION:  LIGHTNING_START_SECONDS = Seconds (MAX DOMAINS)
#
#     The lightning_start_seconds parameter specifies the number of seconds following the
#     start of a simulation to turn ON the lightning scheme. The default and recommended
#     value is 600 seconds (10 minutes), which allows for the simulation to spin up and
#     hopefully suppress "flash-rate fireworks".
#
#  DEFAULT: Stick with 600 (seconds).
#
LIGHTNING_START_SECONDS = 600.


#  OPTION:  FLASHRATE_FACTOR - Factor to adjust the predicted number of flashes (MAX DOMAINS)
#
#     The existence of the flashrate_factor parameter is one of the reasons why the
#     lightning scheme is not best suited for real-time applications. The WRF
#     documentation recommends a value of 1 for lightning_option = 11, which is used
#     with CU schemes, but then "suggests" manual tuning of all other options indepen-
#     dently for each nest. No other guidance is provided, which is understandable
#     after you have read J. Wong et al. (see above).
#
#     A previous version of the WRF Chem user guide (V3.3) suggests scaling the
#     flashrate_factor value for each nested domain at the parent:child DX ratio,
#     so if flashrate_factor = 1 for the parent then a value of 0.33 would be used
#     for a child domain assuming a 1:3 DX ratio. However, this recommendation is
#     not included in any current WRF guidance so you are on your own here.
#
#  DEFAULT: FLASHRATE_FACTOR = 1 for all domains
#
FLASHRATE_FACTOR = 1.


#  OPTION:  CLDTOP_ADJUSTMENT - Adjustment from Level of Neutral Bouyancy (LNB) in km (MAX DOMAINS)
#
#     The cldtop_adjustment parameter is only used with LIGHTNING_OPTION = 11,
#     which requires a CU scheme, so if you are using LIGHTNING_OPTION = 1 or 2
#     then you need not worry your pretty little head over what value to use.
#
#     If you are using LIGHTNING_OPTION = 11 then this value becomes problematic,
#     the reasons for which are detailed in Wong et. al., but you already know
#     this, don't you.  The default value is 2 (km). Use it unless you know
#     what you are doing.
#
#  DEFAULT:  CLDTOP_ADJUSTMENT = 2
#
CLDTOP_ADJUSTMENT = 2


#  OPTION:  ICCG_METHOD - IC:CG partitioning method (IC: intra-cloud; CG: cloud-to-ground)
#
#  VALUES:  Select wisely
#
#     0  -  Default method depending on lightning option,
#           Currently all options use iccg_method = 2 by default
#
#     1  -  Constant everywhere, set with namelist options
#           iccg_prescribed_(num|den)# below, default is 0./1. (all CG)
#
#     2  -  Coarsely prescribed 1995-1999 NLDN/OTD climatology based on
#           Boccippio et al. (2001) This is what you get for ICCG_METHOD = 0
#
#     3  -  Parameterization by Price and Rind (1993) based on cold-cloud depth
#
#     4  -  Gridded input via arrays iccg_in_(num|den) from wrfinput for
#           monthly mapped ratios. Points with 0/0 values use ratio
#           defined by iccg_prescribed_(num|den) below. (Not for the UEMS)
#
#  DEFAULT: ICCG_METHOD = 0
#
ICCG_METHOD = 0


#  OPTION:  ICCG_PRESCRIBED_NUM & ICCG_PRESCRIBED_DEN - Numerator & Denominator of IC:CG ratio
#
#     Used only when ICCG_METHOD = 1 or 4, you get to define the IC:CG ratio used.
#     Note that you should not set ICCG_PRESCRIBED_DEN = 0 because bad things can
#     happen to good modelers.
#
#  DEFAULTS: ICCG_PRESCRIBED_NUM = 0.
#            ICCG_PRESCRIBED_DEN = 1.
#
ICCG_PRESCRIBED_NUM = 0.
ICCG_PRESCRIBED_DEN = 1.
