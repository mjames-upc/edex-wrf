#  CONFIGURATION: SURFACE LAYER (SF_SFCLAY_PHYSICS) PHYSICS CONFIGURATION
#
#  NOTE: Please read "run_physics_configuration.README" to learn how the configuration works
# ==============================================================================================
#
#    The SF_SFCLAY_PHYSICS parameter defines the surface layer scheme to use in your
#    simulation. The scheme is NOT the land surface model (LSM), but rather, handles
#    the calculation of necessary information at the surface-atmosphere interface
#    in the model (exchange/transfer coeffs). Because much of this information is
#    used by the PBL scheme, the choice of SF_SFCLAY_PHYSICS is limited by the
#    BL_PBL_PHYSICS setting.
#
#    Some information about surface layer schemes and what they can do for you:
#
#      a.  Handle the calculation of heat, moisture and momentum fluxes between the
#          surface (skin) and reference model level, typically the 1st model, 2m or
#          10m level. These exchange coefficients are used by the LSM.
#
#      b.  Provide friction velocities to PBL scheme
#
#      c.  Provide the surface fluxes over water points (but not over land)
#
#      d.  Calculations are a function of Zo - roughness length
#
#      e.  The roughness length is a function of land-use type
#
#      f.  Roughness lengths are a measure of the “initial” length scale
#          of surface eddies, and generally differ for velocity and scalars
#
#      g.  Some schemes use smaller roughness length for heat than for momentum
#
#      h.  For water points roughness length is a function of surface wind speed
#
#      i.  The exchange coefficient for heat is related to roughness length and u*
#
#
#    The current SF_SFCLAY_PHYSICS options include (NESTING):
#
#      0 - No surface layer                     Use with  bl_pbl_physics = 0
#      1 - Revised MM5 Monin-Obukhov scheme     Use with  bl_pbl_physics = 0,1,5,6,7,8,9,12
#      2 - MYJ Monin-Obukhov similarity theory  Use with  bl_pbl_physics = 0,2,5,6,8,9
#      4 - QNSE Monin-Obukhov similarity theory Use with  bl_pbl_physics = 4
#      5 - MYNN Monin-Obukhov similarity theory Use with  bl_pbl_physics = 5,6
#      7 - Pleim-Xiu surface layer (EPA)        Use with  bl_pbl_physics = 7 and sf_surface_physics = 7
#     10 - TEMF surface layer                   Use with  bl_pbl_physics = 10
#
#    Note that if you do not know which surface layer option to select then just leave
#    SF_SFCLAY_PHYSICS blank (default) and the UEMS will use an appropriate value for your
#    PBL scheme.

#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  General Surface Layer Physics Options (Available for many)
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  OPTION:  FRACTIONAL_SEAICE - Treat sea-ice as fractional field or ice/no-ice
#
#           A set of modifications to better represent processes and conditions over
#           the high latitudes and a capability to allow for fractional sea-ice coverage.
#
#           The option to interpret the sea-ice array as a fractional field was added.
#           The range is 0.0 to 1.0, meaning 0% to 100% coverage of a model grid cell
#           by sea ice.
#
#           If the user selects the fractional sea-ice option, surface layer routines that
#           compute surface exchange coefficients and fluxes are called twice: once for
#           once for open-water conditions and once for ice-cover conditions. The resulting
#           values are then averaged between open-water and ice-cover results, weighted
#           by the sea-ice fraction.
#
#           To use the fractional sea-ice option, a fractional sea-ice field is necessary
#           for input to WRF. This field may come from, for example, NCEP GFS output, or
#           other sources (e.g., various datasets available from the National Snow and Ice
#           Data Center: http://nsidc.org/data/seaice/index.html)
#
#  VALUES:
#       0 - Treat Sea Ice field as 1|0 (All or Nothing)
#       1 - Treat Sea Ice field as a fraction
#
#
#  NOTES:   The FRACTIONAL_SEAICE option may only be used with:
#
#             SF_SURFACE_PHYSICS = 2 (NOAH), 3 (RUC), 4 (NOAH), 7 (Pleim-Xiu), and 8 (SSiB)
#           And
#             SF_SFCLAY_PHYSICS  = 1 (MM5 Monin), 2 (Janjic Monin-Obukhov), 4 (QNSE), 5 (MYNN), and 7 (Pleim-Xiu)
#
#
#  The UEMS SAYS:
#
#          The GFS dataset includes fractional sea ice. So if you are using the GFS to
#          initialize a simulation you should be OK for fractional seaice.
#
#          Another source:  http://nsidc.org/data/seaice/index.html
#
#          Also, tests show that there is NO difference in the netCDF files from metdat
#          when using XICE Vs SEAICE with GFS data as described in the WRF User's Guide.
#          consequently, you should be OK in using FRACTIONAL_SEAICE = 1 without any
#          special configuration. - Just go for it.
#
#          If FRACTIONAL_SEAICE ON (FRACTIONAL_SEAICE=1) SEAICE_THRESHOLD is automatically
#          set to 100.0 K; otherwise, 271.4 K
#
#          For SF_SURFACE_PHYSICS = 8 (SSiB), FRACTIONAL_SEAICE is automatically turned ON since
#          the source code mandates its use.
#
#  DEFAULT: FRACTIONAL_SEAICE = 0
#
FRACTIONAL_SEAICE = 0

#  ANCILLARY SURFACE LAYER PHYSICS CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
#
#  NOTE - The configuration options presented here are probably best
#         categorized as surface layer scheme options (SF_SFCLAY_PHYSICS);
#         however, many are closely tied to the PBL scheme used.
# ==============================================================================================

#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Not So General Surface Layer Physics Options (Available for all)
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  OPTION:  ISFFLX - Source for heat and moisture fluxes from the surface
#
#  NOTES:   The rationale and affects of the ISFFLX setting must take
#           into account the BL_PBL_PHYSICS setting, specifically, whether
#           BL_PBL_PHYSICS is ON or OFF (BL_PBL_PHYSICS = 0).
#
#           As you read through the blather that barely passes as guidance,
#           you should realize that if you are turning the PBL OFF (LES)
#           when nesting, then the only valid value is ISFFLX = 1
#
# ========================================================================
#
#  When the PBL scheme is ON
#
#  VALUES (0 or 1):
#
#       0 - Turn OFF latent & sensible heat fluxes from the surface
#       1 - Turn ON  latent & sensible heat fluxes from the surface
#
#           With the PBL scheme turned ON (normal), this options serves to
#           provide a sensitivity test for the impact of surface fluxes on
#           a simulation.
#
#   The available WRF documentation indicates that ISFFLX = 0 (OFF) is only
#   valid for SF_SFCLAY_PHYSICS 1, 5, or 7, although this is not reflected
#   in the source code, so it may work for other SF_SFCLAY_PHYSICS options.
#
#   That stated, your best option is still SF_SFCLAY_PHYSICS = 1.
#
#  DEFAULT: ISFFLX = 1 (ON) when BL_PBL_PHYSICS is ON
#
# ========================================================================
#
#  When the PBL scheme is OFF (BL_PBL_PHYSICS = 0) regardless of value
#  for SF_SFCLAY_PHYSICS:
#
#  NOTES:   The PBL scheme should only be OFF (BL_PBL_PHYSICS = 0) with
#           grid spacing of 300m or less.  If this is a real data case
#           then consider keeping PBL ON unless unless grid spacing is
#           less than 100m. Additionally, if your DX is less then 1km
#           then strongly consider increasing the number of vertical
#           layers to more than 100.
#
#           When the PBL scheme is OFF you are also turning off the
#           diffusion in your simulation. Thus, when BL_PBL_PHYSICS = 0,
#           you should use DIFF_OPT = 2 and KM_OPT = 2 or 3 (Dynamics).
#
#  VALUES:  (0, 1, or 2):
#
#       0 - Do not use surface latent & sensible heat fluxes, but rather, use
#           the values for tke_drag_coefficient & tke_heat_flux found in the
#           dynamics configuration file. (SF_SFCLAY_PHYSICS = 0 Only)
#
#           This combination, ISFFLX = 0, BL_PBL_PHYSICS = 0, and SF_SFCLAY_PHYSICS = 0,
#           only works with DIFF_OPT = 2 (Dynamics) and appropriate values for
#           tke_drag_coefficient & tke_heat_flux. IDEALIZED SIMULATIONS ONLY
#
#       1 - Use model computed drag (u*), and latent & sensible heat fluxes from
#           the surface.
#
#           To use ISFFLX = 1, SF_SFCLAY_PHYSICS must be ON (unlike value 0) and
#           DIFF_OPT = 2 or 3 (Dynamics).  USE FOR REAL DATA SIMULATIONS WHEN
#           BL_PBL_PHYSICS = 0.
#
#       2 - Use model computed drag (u*), but fluxes are provided by tke_heat_flux
#
#           For this option, SF_SFCLAY_PHYSICS must be ON because that is where u*
#           is derived and appropriate values for tke_heat_flux are needed.
#
#  DEFAULT:  ISFFLX = 1
#
# ========================================================================
#
#  NOTES:  If all the above blather has you worried then just stick with the
#          default value as the UEMS has your back.
#
ISFFLX = 1


# ==================================================================================
#  OPTION:  ISFTCFLX - Alternative surface-layer options for high-wind ocean surface
#
#  NOTES:   Modify surface bulk drag (Donelan) and enthalpy coefficients to be
#           more in line with recent research results of those for tropical storms
#           and hurricanes. This option also includes dissipative heating term in
#           heat flux.
#
#           It is only available for SF_SFCLAY_PHYSICS = 1
#
#  VALUES:
#
#       0 - OFF (default)
#       1 - Constant Z0q (since V3.2) for heat and moisture
#       2 - Garratt formulation, slightly different forms for heat and moisture
#
#  DEFAULT: ISFTCFLX = 0
# ==================================================================================
#
ISFTCFLX = 0


# ==================================================================================
#  OPTION:  IZ0TLND - Switch to control thermal roughness length over land
#
#  VALUES:
#
#       0 - Original or non-vegetation dependent thermal roughness length over land
#       1 - Chen-Zhang thermal roughness length over land, which depends on vegetation height
#
#  NOTES:   Used with SF_SFCLAY_PHYSICS = 1 or 5
#
#  DEFAULT: IZ0TLND = 1
# ==================================================================================
#
IZ0TLND = 1
