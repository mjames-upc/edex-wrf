#  CONFIGURATION: CUMULUS PARAMETERIZATION (CU_PHYSICS) PHYSICS CONFIGURATION
#
#  NOTE: Please read "run_physics_configuration.README" to learn how the configuration works
# ==============================================================================================
#
#    The CU_PHYSICS parameter specifies the cumulus parameterization scheme to be used
#    when running a simulation. General recommendations when using a cumulus scheme:
#
#    For  DX > 10km        - Probably need a cumulus scheme
#
#    For ~3km < DX < 10 km - Case dependent since scale separation is an issue.
#                            Some newer schemes are "scale aware" meaning that they
#                            attempt to address some of the issues limiting the use
#                            of older CU schemes in this range.
#
#    For DX < ~3 km        - Probably do not need a CU scheme although in some cases
#                            a scheme may provide an earlier triggering mechanism
#                            but may also degrade the forecast depending on the scheme
#                            being used.

#
#           Note: KF-CuP has only been tested using for the CAM radiation scheme (ra_sw_physics = 3,

#  ANCILLARY CUMULUS PHYSICS CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
# ==============================================================================================
#

#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Only for Kain-Fritsch (CU_PHYSICS = 1, 11, and 99) Cumulus Schemes
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  OPTION:  KFETA_TRIGGER - Method used to determine whether CU scheme is active
#
#  VALUES:
#
#       1 - Original mass flux trigger method
#       2 - Moisture-advection based trigger (Ma and Tan [2009]) - ARW only
#           May improve results in subtropical regions when large-scale forcing is weak
#       3 - RH-dependent additional perturbation to option 1
#
#  DEFAULT:  KFETA_TRIGGER = 1
#
KFETA_TRIGGER = 1


#  OPTION:  KF_EDRATES - Option to add entrainment/detrainment rates and
#           convective timescale output variables for KF-based cumulus schemes.
#
#  VALUES:
#           0 - No additional output
#           1 - Yes please, even more output cause I can't get enough of this stuff
#
#  DEFAULT:  KF_EDRATES = 0
#
KF_EDRATES = 0


#  OPTION:  CUDT - The number of minutes between calls to the cumulus scheme.
#
#  VALUES:
#           Set CUDT to the number of minutes (integer) between calls to the
#           Kain-Fritsch cumulus schemes. Set CUDT to 0 for every time step.
#
#           CUDT will automatically be set to 0 if you are NOT using KF
#
#           For obvious reasons CUDT is not used if CU_PHYSICS = 0.
#
CUDT = 5


#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Only for the various Grell (CU_PHYSICS = 3 & 5) Cumulus Schemes
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  OPTION:  CUGD_AVEDX - The number of grid boxes over which subsidence is spread
#
#  VALUES:
#
#           Typically set to 1 (1 grid box) for large grid distances of greater than
#           10km but may be increased for smaller grid spacing (E.g., CUGD_AVEDX = 3
#           for DX < 5km). Set CUGD_AVEDX = Auto to have UEMS determine an appropriate
#           value similar to that indicated above. Maximum value is 3 grid boxes.
#
#  DEFAULT:  CUGD_AVEDX = Auto
#
CUGD_AVEDX = Auto


#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Only for New Simplified Arakawa-Schubert (CU_PHYSICS = 14, 84) Scheme
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  OPTION:  NSAS_DX_FACTOR - Turns ON|OFF grid-size awareness
#
#  VALUES:
#
#       0 - Grid-size awareness method is OFF
#       1 - Grid-size awareness method is ON
#
#   Notes:   The functionality of this option is not well documented
#
#  DEFAULT: NSAS_DX_FACTOR = 0
#
NSAS_DX_FACTOR = 0



#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  For use with Grell & KF cumulus schemes (CU_PHYSICS = 1, 3, 5, & maybe 10, 11)
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  OPTION:  CU_RAD_FEEDBACK - Include the sub-grid cloud effects in the
#                              optical depth within the radiation schemes
#
#  VALUES:  T (include) or F (don't include)
#
#  NOTES:   When using CU_PHYSICS = 10 & 11, CU_RAD_FEEDBACK = T by default
#
#  DEFAULT: CU_RAD_FEEDBACK = T (Include)
#
#  Special Note (#%%^$&*!!!): The documentation is confusing/misleading/wrong as too
#                             whether to use cu_rad_feedback with CU_PHYSICS = 10/11.
#                             The WRF namelist.README file says to use it with KF-CUP
#                             (kfcupscheme; CU_PHYSICS = 10) but the WRF source code
#                             only directly uses the value with CU_PHYSICS = 1 and
#                             indirectly (icloud_cu = 2) with CU_PHYSICS = 11.
#
#                             So the UEMS solution to this mess is to automatically
#                             set CU_RAD_FEEDBACK = T for CU_PHYSICS = 10 & 11, and
#                             let the model sort it out.
#
CU_RAD_FEEDBACK = 1


#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Only for Multi-scale KF-CuP (CU_PHYSICS = 10) Scheme.
#
#  Note that some available parameters are not included below because
#  they are hard-coded in the uems for your personal safety.
#
#  Additional warning - The default values listed in this section were
#  determined after reading the limited information in the raw source
#  code for the KF-CuP, so it's subject to change should actual
#  guidance become available.
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  OPTION:  NUMBINS - Number of perturbations for potential temperature and
#                     mixing ratio in the CuP probability distribution function.
#

#     although the recommended value is 21
#
#  DEFAULT:  NUMBINS = 21
#
NUMBINS = 21


#  OPTION:  THBINSIZE - The bin size of potential temperature perturbation
#                        increment (0.1 K).

#
THBINSIZE = 0.1


#  OPTION:  RBINSIZE - The bin size of mixing ratio perturbation increments
#                       (1.0e-4 kg/k).
#
#  DEFAULT: RBINSIZE = 0.0004  (Because that's what module_cu_kfcup.F says)
#
RBINSIZE = 0.0004


#  OPTION:  MINDEEPFREQ - minimum frequency required before deep convection is allowed.
#
#  DEFAULT: MINDEEPFREQ = 0.3333  (Because that's what the WRF guidance recommends:
#                                   http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/wrfv3.8/KF-CuP.htm)
#
MINDEEPFREQ = 0.3333



#  OPTION:  MINSHALLOWFREQ - minimum frequency required before deep convection is allowed.
#
#  DEFAULT: MINSHALLOWFREQ = 0.01  (Because that's what the WRF guidance recommends:
