#  CONFIGURATION: SHALLOW CONVECTION (SHCU_PHYSICS) PHYSICS CONFIGURATION
#
#  NOTE: Please read "run_physics_configuration.README" to learn how the configuration works
# ==============================================================================================
#
#    The SHCU_PHYSICS parameter specifies the scheme to use for including the effects of
#    non-precipitating convective mixing within the PBL and above. The effects of this
#    shallow mixing are to dry the PBL while moistening and cooling the levels above,
#    which may be accomplished though through an enhanced mixing or mass-flux approach.
#
#    Inclusion of shallow cumulus parameterization may be useful at grid sizes greater
#    than 1km (DX > 1km) since shallow cumulus clouds are typically not resolved at
#    this scale.
#
#    In many instances, the addition of a shallow cumulus scheme may not be necessary as
#    the effects may already be included with the chosen CU_PHYSICS option. This would
#    include CU_PHYSICS options 1 (KF), 2 (BMJ), 4, TiedTKE (6), 10, 11, 14, 16, and 84 (SAS).
#
#    Grell CU schemes 3 & 5 have a shallow convection option that can be turned ON by
#    setting SHCU_PHYSICS = 1, which sets automatically ishallow = 1 in the namelist file.
#
#    The MYNN schemes (5 & 6) have an mass flux option that accounts for the affects of
#    shallow cumulus clouds. Thus, setting SHCU_PHYSICS to a non-zero value will turn ON
#    the scheme specific option (BL_MYNN_EDMF=1) and turn OFF any independent scheme. So if
#    you set SHCU_PHYSICS = 3 (GRIMS) with BL_PBL_PHYSICS = 5 or 6, the internal MYNN EDMF
#    scheme will be used instead of GRIMS. That's the way it works. I don't just make the
#    rules, I enforce them too.
#
#    The TEMF and QNSE PBL schemes also include the effects of shallow convection. For
#    the QNSE scheme, this option can be turned ON by setting SHCU_PHYSICS to a non-zero,
#    value, in which case any independent Shallow CU scheme will be turned OFF. #
#
#    The TEMF PBL shallow CU scheme is always ON whether you like it or not, so all
#    independent shallow CU schemes will be turned off SHCU_PHYSICS = 0).
#
#    WARNING - be careful when selecting your physics schemes as you may be double counting
#    effects of shallow convection. This is especially likely when running a CU scheme
#    (CU_PHYSICS) since many schemes already include the effects of shallow cumulus.
#
#    For the Zhang-McFarlane CU Scheme (7) or when not including CU parameterization (0),
#    the effects of shallow convection may be initiated by using SHCU_PHYSICS 2 with the
#    appropriate PBL scheme:
#
#        SHCU_PHYSICS = 0  - Just turn the shallow convection OFF - Note that this will also turn OFF
#                            the shallow cumulus option for any CU or PBL schemes that have an independent
#                            shallow CU option such as CU_PHYSICS = 3,5 and BL_PBL_PHYSICS = 4,10.
#                            However, some physics schemes have an integrated shallow cumulus scheme
#                            that can not be turned off, in which case SHCU_PHYSICS=0 will do diddly.
#
#
#        SHCU_PHYSICS = 1  - For Grell CU schemes 3 & 5 only
#
#        SHCU_PHYSICS = 2  - Park and Bretherton shallow cumulus from CAM5
#
#                            Must use TKE PBL scheme (BL_PBL_PHYSICS = 2, 8, 9, or 12), although
#                            BL_PBL_PHYSICS = 9 is preferred choice (UW - Bretherton and Park)
#
#                            Note that if you want a shallow CU scheme with BL_PBL_PHYSICS = 4, it
#                            is better to set SHCU_PHYSICS = -1, which will turn ON the optional
#                            shallow CU effects within the QNSE-EDMF PBL scheme rather than using
#                            the independent stand-alone parameterization, UNLESS you are also using
#                            a CU_PHYSICS option that also supports shallow convection, of which
#                            there are many.  If this is the case then just set SHCU_PHYSICS = 0.
#
#        SHCU_PHYSICS = 3  - GRIMS shallow cumulus from YSU
#
#                            Must use BL_PBL_PHYSICS = 1 (YSU) (Per source code - 11?)
#
#                            Warning on GRIMS! - It it currently recommended that you not use
#                            SHCU_PHYSICS = 3 due to persistent floating point errors encountered
#                            during UEMS testing.  You may still use it at your own risk.
#
#
#    If you want to feel the sweet shallow convective effects in your simulation but don't
#    want to bother figuring out all the rules of engagement, then just use the Auto-
#    configuration option (-1) and the UEMS will figure out the rest. Because you're a modeler
#    and have better things to do with your time.
#
#  DEFAULT:  SHCU_PHYSICS = -1   Auto-config me baby! (Turn ON when possible)
#
SHCU_PHYSICS = -1
