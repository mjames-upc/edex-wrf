#  THE WRF DYNAMICS CONFIGURATION FILE
# ==============================================================================================
#
# IMPORTANT USER INFORMATION - Read on if you dare
#
#   Below you will find the settings that control the DYNAMICS configuration of the
#   WRF model. The model dynamics includes the grid staggering, vertical coordinate
#   system, time integration, advection, mixing and diffusion schemes, vertical velocity
#   damping, filtering, and lots of other configurable parameters you shouldn't be
#   mess'n with unless you know what you are doing.
#
#   Some of the parameters below allow you to specify a different value for each domain
#   included in your simulation (MAX DOMAINS).  However, as with the physics options, it
#   is recommended that you keep the same value for all domains, which is done by assigning
#   a single to a parameter.
#
#   Finally, as always, some of the information provided below was freely "liberated" from
#   various sources including the WRF user's guide, tutorials, and on-line training. Thus,
#   the original authors should receive credit for any moments of clarity you experience
#   while reading this file.

#  OPTION: HYBRID_OPT (NEW) - Use either a terrain following or a hybrid vertical coordinate
#
#     The HYBRID_OPT defines the vertical coordinate used in a simulation. The options are
#     either a terrain following (TF) vertical coordinate (original WRF coordinate) or a
#     new hybrid vertical coordinate (HVC). The new hybrid vertical coordinate uses the
#     terrain following coordinate within the lower part of a model atmosphere and gradually
#     transition to an isobaric coordinate at a defined level (See ETAC below). The benefit
#     of this coordinate option is to reduce the artificial influence of topography towards
#     the top of the model.
#
#     The UEMS includes this compile/run-time option as part of the pre-built binaries
#     provided with the release so you are free to use the new hybrid coordinate with
#     passion!
#
#  VALUES:
#
#     HYBRID_OPT = 0  - Original terrain following coordinate (TF)
#     HYBRID_OPT = 2  - New hybrid vertical coordinate (HVC)
#
#  DEFAULT: HYBRID_OPT = 0 (for now)
#
HYBRID_OPT = 0


#  OPTION: GWD_OPT  - Gravity Wave Drag Scheme
#
#    The Gravity Wave Drag and Mountain Blocking scheme attempts to account for sub-grid
#    scale mountain effects. Tests using the gravity wave drag option on the operational
#    NAM at NCEP has shown an improvement in overall synoptic scale  and near-surface
#    wind and temperature forecasts.
#
#    The use of gravity wave drag parameterization is suggested:
#
#      a.  When DX > 10km
#      b.  With simulations longer than 5 days
#      c.  Over large domains with mountain ranges
#
#    The Gravity wave drag parameterization incorporates the effects of mountain wave
#    stress and pressure drag. The vertical distribution of wave stress effects the winds
#    aloft due to momentum deposition.
#
#    The "Mountain Blocking" component attempts to account for the effects of flow around
#    subgrid scale topography wherein low-level flow is blocked below a dividing streamline
#    and is forced around and not over barriers.
#
#  NOTES:  For the ARW, this option should only be used un-rotated lat/long (e.g. global)
#          or Mercator projections because the input orographic sub-grid asymmetry arrays
#          assume this grid orientation.
#
#  INFO:  Per module_check_a_mundo.F (V3.7) The GWD option only works with YSU & MYNN PBL!
#
#    Set GWD_OPT to 1 to turn ON gravity wave drag in the model, 0 to turn it OFF.
#
#  DEFAULT:  GWD_OPT = 0 (OFF)
#
GWD_OPT = 0


#  OPTION:  RK_ORD - Time-integration scheme to use.
#
#  VALUES:
#
#     2 - Runge-Kutta 2nd order
#     3 - Runge-Kutta 3rd order  (Recommended)
#
#         *  RK3 is 3rd order accurate for linear eqns,
#           2nd order accurate for nonlinear eqns.
#
#         *  Stable for centered and upwind advection
#           schemes.
#
#         *  Stable for Courant number Udt/dx < 1.73
#
#  NOTES:  The higher the order, the more accuracy. The more accuracy, the better you feel!
#
#           If RK_ORD = 2 then an ODD order advection must be used; unstable otherwise
#
#  DEFAULT: RK_ORD = 3
#
RK_ORD = 3


# ==============================================================================================
#  A VARIETY OF ADVECTION SCHEMES FROM WHICH TO CHOOSE
# ==============================================================================================
#

#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#    Horizontal advection options
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   Method of advection for scalar variables (VALUES: 0,1,2,3, and 4) (NESTED)
#   But some are better than others.
#
#     0 - Simple advection
#     1 - Positive-Definite Advection (default) - Required for water conservation
#     2 - Monotonic - Reduces overshooting maxima; Good for chemistry
#     3 - 5th order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO)
#     4 - 5th order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) with Positive Definite
#
#         Both WENO options are designed to reduce oscillations at cloud edges during
#         high resolution simulations. Also beneficial for reducing noise with
#         double moment microphysics simulations (high resolution).
#
#   The default value is Positive-Definite (1).
#
#   Some pearls of wisdom from the WRF developers regarding the monotonic
#   and positive-definite advection OPTIONS:
#
#   "The positive-definite and monotonic options are available for moisture,
#    scalars, chemical scalars and TKE in the ARW solver.  Both the monotonic
#    and positive-definite transport options conserve scalar mass locally and
#    globally and are consistent with the ARW mass conservation equation. We
#    recommend using the positive-definite option for moisture variables on
#    all real-data simulations. "
#
#    Lots more jewels:
#
#    1. "The integration sequence in ARW changes when the positive-definite
#        or monotonic options are used.  When the options are not activated,
#        the timestep tendencies from the physics (excluding microphysics) i
#        are used to update the scalar mixing ratio at the same time as the
#        transport (advection), and the microphysics is computed and moisture
#        is updated based on the transport+physics update.  When the monotonic
#        or positive definite options are activated, the scalar mixing ratio is
#        first updated with the physics tendency, and the new updated values are
#        used as the starting values for the transport scheme.  The microphysics
#        update occurs after the transport update using these latest values as
#        its starting point. It is important to remember that for any scalars,
#        the local and global conservation properties, positive definiteness and
#        monotonicity depend upon each update possessing these properties."
#
#    2. "Some model filters may not be positive definite:
#
#        i.  diff_6th_opt = 1 is neither positive definite nor monotonic.  Use
#           diff_6th_opt = 2 if you need this diffusion option (diff_6th_opt = 2
#           is monotonic and positive-definite).  We have encountered cases where
#           the departures from monotonicity and positive-definiteness have been
#           very noticeable.
#
#        ii. diff_opt = 1 and km_opt = 4 (a commonly-used real-data case mixing option)
#           is not guaranteed to be positive-definite nor monotonic due to the variable
#           eddy diffusivity K.  We have not observed significant departures from
#           positive-definiteness or monotonicity when this filter is used with these
#           transport options.
#
#        iii.The diffusion option that uses a user-specified constant eddy viscosity
#           is positive definite and monotonic.
#
#        iv. Other filter options that use variable eddy viscosity are not positive
#           definite or monotonic."
#
#    3.  "Most of the model physics are not monotonic nor should they be - they represent
#         sources and sinks in the system.  All should be positive definite, although we
#         have not examined and tested all options for this property."
#
#    4.  "The monotonic option (2) adds significant smoothing to the transport in regions
#         where it is active.  You may want to consider turning off the other model
#         filters for variables using monotonic transport (filters such as the second
#         and sixth order horizontal filters)."
#
#    5.   If you are using a double moment microphysics scheme, you should consider
#         WENO (4 & 5) if your simulations fields are noisy.
#
#    6.   "PDA" stands for "Positive-Definite Advection" and not "Public Display of
#           Affection", but you're a scientist and wouldn't know about that kind of stuff.
#
#    Frightened Yet? Ya, me too.
#
#    GLOBAL USERS TAKE NOTE:
#
#    If you are running a simulation on a global (lat-lon) grid then neither Positive
#    Definite (1) nor Monotonic (2) advection should be used as they do not play well with
#    the polar filters.  Instead use simple advection (0), and if you forget it will be
#    forced upon you.  This restriction is not placed on regional latitude-longitude
#    grids in the UEMS although the documentation is not clean regarding the use of PDA
#    with regional latitude-longitude grids.
#
#    The Positive-Definite Advection is only valid with moisture (moist_adv_opt),
#    scalar (scalar_adv_opt), chemistry variables (chem_adv_opt) and TKE (tke_adv_opt)
#
#  DEFAULTS: MOIST_ADV_OPT = 1 (PDA)
#            SCALAR_ADV_OPT = 1 (PDA)
#            CHEM_ADV_OPT = 1 (PDA)
#            TKE_ADV_OPT = 1 (PDA)
#
MOIST_ADV_OPT = 1
SCALAR_ADV_OPT = 1
CHEM_ADV_OPT = 1
TKE_ADV_OPT = 1


#  OPTION:  MOMENTUM_ADV_OPT - Advection of Horizontal Momentum
#
#  VALUES:
#
#     1 -  Standard Scheme (Not sure what "standard" means)
#     3 -  5th order WENO  (As described above)
#
#  DEFAULT:  MOMENTUM_ADV_OPT = 1
#
MOMENTUM_ADV_OPT = 1


#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Horizontal Advection Order for Momentum & Scalars
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  OPTIONS: H_MOM_ADV_ORDER & H_SCA_ADV_ORDER
#
#     Horizontal advection order may be 2nd through 6th order with 5th order (5)
#     being the recommended value. Note that you should use an ODD order.
#
#     The odd-ordered flux divergence schemes are equivalent to the next higher
#     ordered (even) flux-divergence scheme plus a dissipation term of the
#     higher even order with a coefficient proportional to the Courant number.
#
#     H_MOM_ADV_ORDER  - Horizontal momentum advection order
#     H_SCA_ADV_ORDER  - Horizontal scalar advection order
#
#  DEFAULTS:  H_MOM_ADV_ORDER = 5
#             H_SCA_ADV_ORDER = 5
#
H_MOM_ADV_ORDER = 5
H_SCA_ADV_ORDER = 5


#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Vertical Advection Order for Momentum & Scalars
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  OPTIONS: V_MOM_ADV_ORDER & V_SCA_ADV_ORDER
#
#     Vertical advection order may be 2nd through 6th order with 3rd order (3)
#     being the recommended value. Note that you should use an ODD order.
#
#     V_MOM_ADV_ORDER  - Vertical momentum advection order
#     V_SCA_ADV_ORDER  - Vertical scalar advection order
#
#  DEFAULTS:  V_MOM_ADV_ORDER = 3
#             V_SCA_ADV_ORDER = 3
#
V_MOM_ADV_ORDER = 3
V_SCA_ADV_ORDER = 3


# ==============================================================================================
#  A VARIETY OF DIFFUSION AND DAMPING OPTIONS FROM WHICH TO CHOOSE
# ==============================================================================================
#
# Diffusion in WRF is categorized under two parameters, the diffusion option and
# the K option. The diffusion option selects how the derivatives used in diffusion
# are calculated, and the K option selects how the K coefficients are calculated.
# Note that when a PBL option is selected, vertical diffusion is done by the PBL
# scheme, and not by the diffusion scheme.
#
# Note that if you are running a LES simulation the ems_run routine will attempt to
# configure your run with the appropriate settings.
#
# RECOMMENDATIONS - Real-data cases with PBL physics turned ON (dx > 500m)
#     a. DIFF_OPT = 1
#     b. KM_OPT = 4
#   Compliments vertical diffusion done by PBL scheme
#
# RECOMMENDATIONS - Cloud resolving models with smooth or no topography
#     a. DIFF_OPT = 1
#     b. KM_OPT = 2 or 3
#
# RECOMMENDATIONS - LES and cloud resolving simulations with complex topography and NO PBL
#     a. DIFF_OPT = 2 <- more accurate for strongly sloped coordinate surfaces
#     b. KM_OPT = 2 or 3
#     c. SFS_OPT = 0, 1, or 2
#
# NOTE: KM_OPT = 2 appears to be more stable than KM_OPT = 3
#
# When running an LES simulation:
#     c. No WRF mesoscale -> LES nested simulations allowed (yet)
#     d. Start with Super hi-res BCs from WRF simulation
#     e. Do 2-way LES -> LES nest
#     f. Must be 3D
#     g. Grid spacing must be << energy-containing eddies (to resolve “large eddies”)
#     h. Set domain to be ~ 5 times of PBL height zi and vertical domain ~ 2 zi
#     i. Turn off PBL schemes; use 3D diffusion (the TKE diffusion scheme)
#     j. If nesting, be careful about spin-up process
#
# Finally: DIFF_OPT = 2, KM_OPT = 4 is now an option for high resolution (DX < 1km)
#           real data cases over complex terrain; HOWEVER, this is not to be confused
#           with a "guaranteed not to fail" option. Your experiences may less than
#           successful and you will have to live with it.
# ==============================================================================================
#

#  OPTION:  DIFF_OPT  - turbulence and mixing (diffusion) scheme (MAX DOMAINS)
#
#     DIFF_OPT specifies which turbulence and mixing (diffusion) scheme to use.
#     Current options include:
#
#       0 - No diffusion. Note that the value of KM_OPT is ignored.
#           Some vertical diffusion is still done in the PBL scheme.
#
#           It's ok to use DIFF_OPT = 0 for real-data cases.
#
#       1 - Simple diffusion. Evaluates the 2nd order diffusion term on
#           coordinate surfaces, which is fine in most cases unless the
#           model surfaces have extreme slope, such as with well-resolved
#           complex terrain. Problem because large model surface slopes
#           introduce a vertical component in the mixing that is not
#           correct.
#
#           Recommended for real-data cases. May be used with KM_OPT = 1,4
#
#           If BL_PBL_PHYSICS = 0, Uses KVDIF
#
#       2 - Full diffusion. Evaluates mixing terms in physical space
#           (horizontally), which provides a more accurate result over
#           complex (steep) terrain but may be unstable.
#
#           A bit more computationally expensive since it requires a
#           vertical correction term and additional data points in the
#           calculation.
#
#           Value of EPSSM (sound wave damper) may need to be increased
#           to 0.5 or greater to improve stability.
#
#           Also set in the ancillary option section:
#              MIX_FULL_FIELDS = T
#              ISFFLX = 1 or 2  (In run_physics_surfacelayer.conf)
#              KM_OPT = 2, 3, or 4
#              DAMP_OPT = 0
#
#     You can now specify a DIFF_OPT value for each domain. This should only
#     be done if you are nesting down to an LES or to a sub 500m dx over
#     complex terrain.
#
#     Finally, the UEMS will automatically set DIFF_OPT = 2 for all domains
#     where the PBL scheme is turned OFF (0).
#
DIFF_OPT = 1


#  OPTION:  KM_OPT - Eddy coefficient (K) configuration
#
#    KM_OPT defines the Eddy coefficient (K) option to use.  When using a PBL
#    only options (1) and (4) below make sense, because (2) and (3) are
#    designed for 3D diffusion and would duplicate some of the diffusion
#    done by the PBL scheme.
#
#    Current options include:
#
#        1 - Constant value (Horizontal and vertical diffusion is specified
#           by KHDIF and KVDIF respectively)
#
#        2 - 1.5 order TKE closure (3D)(K). A prognostic equation for
#           turbulent kinetic energy is used, and K is based on TKE.
#           Requires DIFF_OPT = 2
#
#        3 - Smagorinsky first order closure (3D)  wherein K is diagnosed
#           from 3d deformation and stability. Requires DIFF_OPT = 2
#
#           KM_OPT = 3 appears to be less stable than KM_OPT = 2
#
#        4 - Horizontal Smagorinsky first order closure (2D) wherein K for
#           horizontal diffusion is diagnosed from just horizontal deformation.
#           The vertical diffusion is assumed to be done by the PBL scheme.
#
#           May improve stability when DIFF_OPT = 2
#
#    Note that options 2 and 3 are NOT recommended for DX > 500m and should only
#    be used when running without a PBL scheme since they do 3D diffusion.
#    Also, KM_OPT = 2 appears to be more stable than KM_OPT = 3.
#
#    Options 1 and 4 is recommended for real-data cases since they compliment
#    vertical diffusion dome by the PBL scheme.
#
KM_OPT = 4


#  OPTION:  DIFF_6TH_OPT - 6th order diffusion configuration
#
#    6th order diffusion will be applied to all variables to serve
#    as a short-wave numerical noise filter. May be used for real-data
#    simulations.
#
#    Values for DIFF_6TH_OPT include:
#
#        0 - None (default unless Positive Definite Advection used)
#        1 - 6th order diffusion ON (can produce negative moisture - Not allowed in UEMS)
#        2 - 6th order diffusion ON and prohibit up-gradient diffusion
#           which is better for moisture conservation. SHOULD BE USED
#           IN COMBINATION WITH Positive Definite Advection
#
#    DIFF_6TH_FACTOR is the non-dimensional strength of the diffusion.
#    typical value is 0.12. A value of 1.0 will result in complete
#    removal of 2*dx waves in a single time step (Ouch!).
#
#  DEFAULTS:  DIFF_6TH_OPT = <blank>
#           DIFF_6TH_FACTOR = 0.25   (when ON)
#
#
#  NOTE: If DIFF_6TH_OPT = <blank> (Default), then it will be turned ON
#        in combination with Positive Definite Advection, otherwise OFF.
#
#        DIFF_6TH_OPT will be turned OFF with monotonic advection
#        due to heavy filtering (WRF recommendation)
#
DIFF_6TH_OPT = 0
DIFF_6TH_FACTOR = 0.25



#  OPTION:  DAMP_OPT - Upper-level damping option
#
#  VALUES:
#
#         0 - No damping (Default - may be used for global)
#
#         1 - Upper level diffusion layer. Enhanced horizontal diffusion
#           at the top. Cosine function of height. May be used with
#           real-data cases. Uses DAMPCOEF ~0.1 to 0.01 and ZDAMP
#
#         2 - Upper-level relaxation towards 1-d profile. Also uses
#           DAMPCOEF. Rayleigh damping (DAMPCOEF inverse time
#           scale [1/s], e.g. 0.003) Idealized cases only - Not used with UEMS
#
#         3 - W-Rayleigh relaxation layer. Only damps vertical
#           motions. Upper-level relaxation towards zero vertical
#           motion. Uses DAMPCOEF and ZDAMP. Suggest DAMPCOEF = 0.2
#           May be used with real-data cases. (Default for global)
#
#  NOTES:   DAMP_OPT controls the upper-level damping. Either a layer of
#           increased diffusion or a Rayleigh relaxation layer can be added
#           near the model top to control reflection from the upper boundary.
#
#           DAMP_OPT = 3 has been shown to be very effective at producing
#           proper mountain wave tilts consistent with no reflection off the
#           model top.
#
#  DEFAULT: DAMP_OPT = 0
#
DAMP_OPT = 0


#  OPTION:  DAMPCOEF - The non-dimensional maximum magnitude for damping
#
#  VALUES:
#           Set DAMPCOEF < = 0.2 for real data cases
#
#  DEFAULT: DAMPCOEF = 0.2
#
DAMPCOEF = 0.2


#  OPTION:  ZDAMP (Nested) - Depth over which damping is applied
#
#  NOTES:   ZDAMP is the depth (meters) from the model top over which
#           to apply damping with DAMP_OPT = 1 or 3.
#
#  DEFAULT: ZDAMP = 5000
#
ZDAMP = 5000.


#  OPTION:  W_DAMPING - Turn ON|OFF vertical velocity damping
#
#  VALUES:
#
#     0 - No  damping
#     1 - Yes damping
#
#  NOTES:   W_DAMPING sets the vertical velocity damping can be used for
#           real-time simulations. Vertical motion is damped to prevent
#           the model from becoming unstable with locally large vertical
#           velocities.  This only affects strong updraft cores so it
#           has very little impact on results otherwise.
#
#           For real-time and case study simulations it is recommended
#           that W_DAMPING = 1.
#
#  DEFAULT:  W_DAMPING = 1
#
W_DAMPING = 1


#  OPTION:  FFT_FILTER_LAT - Latitude at which to initiate FFT (Global Only)
#
#  NOTES:   FFT_FILTER_LAT is the latitude at which the FFT routines begin
#           to filter out high-frequency waves when running over global domain.
#           Again, this value is only applicable to global domain runs.
#
#           Setting this value to 90. (degrees) will eliminate FFT filtering
#           and probably cause your simulation to crash due to CFL violations
#           unless your time step is unreasonably small. The value will be
#           ignored for limited area domains EXCEPT for lat-lon domains when
#           the adaptive time step is turned ON, in which event the value
#           will be set to 89. degrees internally within the UEMS.
#
#  DEFAULT: FFT_FILTER_LAT = 45. (Global Domains)
#           FFT_FILTER_LAT = 89. (Regional Lat-Lon domains with adaptive timestep ON
#
FFT_FILTER_LAT = 45.


#  OPTION:  USE_THETA_M - Option to use moist theta = theta(1+1.61Qv) in WRF solver
#
#  VALUES:
#
#     0 - Use dry theta in dynamics
#     1 - Use moist theta (theta_m = theta(1+1.61Qv) )
#
#  NOTES:
#
#     a.  For LES simulations
#     b.  Only works with a SINGLE DOMAIN, .i.e, no nests
#     c.  May not be used with damp_opt=2 (Not a problem since damp_opt=2 is not supported with UEMS)
#     d.  The option may not be used with rad_nudge (Also not UEMS supported)
#
#     !   Per b above, USE_THETA_M will automatically be set to 0 for multiple domains.
#
#  DEFAULT: USE_THETA_M = 0 (Old behavior)
#
USE_THETA_M = 0


#  OPTION:  USE_Q_DIABATIC - Included QV and QC tendencies in advection
#
#  VALUES:
#
#     0 - Don't Advect QV and QC tendencies
#     1 - Advect QV and QC tendencies
#
#  NOTES:   Helps to produce correct solution in an idealized 'moist benchmark'
#           test case. In real data cases requires that timestep be reduced.

# ANCILLARY CONFIGURATION SETTINGS YOU PROBABLY DO NOT NEED TO WORRY ABOUT
# ==============================================================================================
#

# ==============================================================================================
#  ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATION PARAMETER USED WITH HYBRID_OPT
#
#  OPTION:  ETAC - ETA level at which the WRF model surfaces become isobaric
#
#  NOTES:   Used with HYBRID_OPT = 2 only
#
#  Liberated Information:
#
#           ETAC allows the user to select the eta level at which the WRF model surfaces
#           become completely isobaric. As the value of ETAC increases (from 0 towards 1),
#           more eta levels are impacted as increasing numbers of levels (downward from
#           the model top) are flattened out,  which is normally a good thing. However,
#           over areas of high topography (not necessarily steep or complex), the vertical
#           eta levels get too compressed when ETAC values larger than about ETAC = 0.22.
#           Over the Himalayan Plateau with a 10 hPa model lid, a value of ETAC = 0.25
#           causes model failures. Globally then, a value of 0.2 is considered "safe".
#
#  DEFAULT: ETAC = 0.20
#
ETAC = 0.20

#           than 20 km (~50 mb). Note: This option is only available for real data,
#           em-only. This is a representative temperature at sea-level in the middle of
#           your domain, regardless of the topography height at that point. Typical
#           values range from 270-300 K. This value must stay the same through
#           initialization, model runs, and restarts.
