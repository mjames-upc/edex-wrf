#  CONFIGURATION: THE WRF AUXILIARY HISTORY OUTPUT CONFIGURATION FILE
# ==============================================================================================
#
# IMPORTANT USER INFORMATION - Read on if you dare
#
#   Below you will find the settings that control the output of the WRF auxiliary
#   history (forecast) files. Please review and modify as necessary.
#
#   Parameter configuration descriptions below containing "MAX DOMAINS" allow for the
#   inclusion of separate values for each LOCALIZED DOMAIN.
#
#   For Example:
#
#     SOME_PARM = Primary Domain, domain 2, domain 3, ..., domain N
#
#   The first value specified in the list will be applied to the primary domain with
#   each successive value assigned to the corresponding sub domain. All entries must
#   be separated by a comma (,). For example, let's say that you created and localized
#   file domains with Domain Wizard.  You could specify a different configuration
#   option for each domain (Don't try this at home - See potential fire hazard above):
#
#     SOME_PARM = 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0
#
#   If you include all five domains in your simulation, then the primary domain will
#   get a value of 5, domain two will get a value of 4, and finally domain five will
#   get assigned a value of 1.  The "0" at the end of the list will be ignored since
#   there are six values and only five domains.
#
#   Should you fail to include an entry for each domain fear not as the UEMS will use
#   the value of the PARENT domain.
#
#   Note: The current UEMS allows for up to 2 different auxiliary files to be output
#         from a simulation. The fields in these files have been predefined and can't
#         be changed without recompiling the model.
#
#         The configuration file used for each auxiliary history file is identified by
#         the filename, run_auxhist#.conf, where # (1..N) represents the auxiliary WRF
#         dataset output during the run.

#

#  OPTION:  AUXHIST1_INTERVAL - Auxiliary file output frequency (MAX DOMAINS)
#
#  VALUES:  AUXHIST1_INTERVAL specifies the frequency, in minutes, of the simulation
#           output for each domain. For example, AUXHIST1_INTERVAL = 60, is hourly;
#           AUXHIST1_INTERVAL = 30 is every 30 minutes, etc.
#
#           AUXHIST1_INTERVAL = 180,60 is 3-hourly for the primary domain and hourly
#           for domain 2 or the first nested domain.
#
#           Setting AUXHIST1_INTERVAL = Auto, specifies that you want to use the same
#           output frequency as the primary files defined in run_wrfout.conf
#
#           Setting AUXHIST1_INTERVAL = 0 turns OFF all auxiliary output!
#
#  DEFAULT: AUXHIST1_INTERVAL = 0 (OFF)
#
AUXHIST1_INTERVAL = 0



#  OPTION:  FRAMES_PER_AUXHIST1 - Number of output times per file (MAX DOMAINS)
#
#  VALUES:  FRAMES_PER_AUXHIST1 is the number of output times to write to each simulation
#           file.  Typically, a user would specify FRAMES_PER_AUXHIST1 = 1, which is one
#           time period per file, or FRAMES_PER_AUXHIST1 > = total number of output times,
#           if the user wants all times written to a single monolithic file.
#
#  DEFAULT: Use FRAMES_PER_AUXHIST1 = 1
#
FRAMES_PER_AUXHIST1 = 1

#  ANCILLARY CONFIGURATION SETTINGS YOU PROBABLY DO NOT NEED TO WORRY ABOUT
# ==============================================================================================
#

#  OPTION:  AUXHIST1_NAMEKEY - UEMS  auxiliary diagnostics filename key
#
#  VALUES:  The AUXHIST1_NAMEKEY parameter is a string that will be used to complete
#           the naming convention for the AFWA diagnostics fields.  All files will
#           name the convention of "<outname>_d<domain>_<date>"; however, you will
#           be able to replace the "<outname>" with the string defined by the
#           AUXHIST1_NAMEKEY parameter.
#
#  NOTES:   It is recommended that you leave well enough along and go pick on
#           another configuration file. Changing AUXHIST1_NAMEKEY from the default
#           may cause the UEMS post processing to fail since the routines key on
#           these strings.
#
#  DEFAULT: AUXHIST1_NAMEKEY = auxhist1
#
AUXHIST1_NAMEKEY = auxhist1
