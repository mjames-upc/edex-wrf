# THE WRF VERTICAL LEVELS CONFIGURATION FILE
# ==============================================================================================
#
#   This file contains the parameters necessary to configure the number of vertical levels
#   or layers in your domain.  With the exception of the LEVELS parameter below, you
#   probably will not need to edit the values in this file, as they have been carefully
#   chosen for you using the infinite wisdom and experience collected from nearly hours
#   of modeling experience. Your simulation is safe in our hands.

#
#  OPTION:  LEVELS
#
#     LEVELS is used to defined the number and/or the vertical distribution of
#     the levels to be used in your simulation. Note that ALL the domains will
#     use the same vertical structure. No need to get silly.
#
#     The value specified to LEVELS may either be a single integer, which simply
#     represents the number of levels to be used in the simulation OR a series
#     of values representing individual model ETA levels separated by a comma (,).
#
#     If you choose to specify the number of vertical levels with a single integer
#     value, e.g. LEVELS = 45, the WRF real program will use this value to generate
#     a set of well-spaced levels. However, the number of levels is up to you.
#     The default value for LEVELS is 45 but feel free to increase this value as
#     necessary. THIS IS THE RECOMMENDED METHOD.
#
#     If you feel that you must manually define the vertical structure of the
#     model domain, then simply provide a list of whole ETA level values, ranging
#     from 1. to 0. (inclusive) separated by a commas (,). Here is an example
#     for a model domain with 35 levels:
#
#       LEVELS = 1.000, 0.993, 0.983, 0.970, 0.954, 0.934, 0.909, 0.880,
#                0.845, 0.807, 0.765, 0.719, 0.672, 0.622, 0.571, 0.520,
#                0.468, 0.420, 0.376, 0.335, 0.298, 0.263, 0.231, 0.202,
#                0.175, 0.150, 0.127, 0.106, 0.088, 0.070, 0.055, 0.040,
#                0.026, 0.013, 0.000
#
#     Using the --levels command line OPTION:
#
#     The --levels command line option serves to override the LEVELS parameter
#     in this file. The only difference is that  --levels ONLY accepts the
#     number of levels and not the vertical distribution.
#
#     Failing to define the number of vertical levels by any method will force
#     ems_run to use the default value (45).
#
#     Finally, just remember that increasing the number of levels will
#     proportionally increase the amount of time required to run your simulation.
#
#  DEFAULT: LEVELS = 45  (Because that seems like a reasonable number)
#
LEVELS = 45


#  OPTION:  PTOP
#
#     PTOP defines the pressure, in pascals (i.e. 5000pa = 50mb), to use as
#     the top of your model domain. The pressure level defined by PTOP MUST
#     coincide with a level in your initialization data. So, ems_run will
#     check the contents of the WPS initialization files to determine if that
#     level is contained in the file. If the level does not exist in your
#     initialization data then ems_run will automatically redefine PTOP to
#     the top pressure level in the dataset and provide you with a warning.
#
#     Don't want to think about it? Sure, who does?  Just leave PTOP blank
#     and the UEMS will determine an appropriate value for you.
#
#  DEFAULT: PTOP = 5000 (pascals) is a good default value.
#
PTOP = 5000
