#  CONFIGURATION: THE WRF DIGITAL FILTER INITIALIZATION (DFI) CONFIGURATION FILE
# ==============================================================================================
#
#   This file contains the parameters necessary to use Digital Filter Initialization (DFI)
#   at the start of your simulation. DFI allows for the reduction in the model "spin-up"
#   time during the early stages of integration due to a mass/momentum imbalance in the
#   in the initial conditions.
#
#   Note that the use of DFI can increase the computational time of your model run sig-
#   nificantly, so use this option wisely. Also testing has been limited so there are
#   few promises as to whether this option will work as advertised. See the PDF file(s)
#   in the ems/docs directory for more fun facts about what DFI can do for you.
#
#
# LIFTED FROM THE WRF USERS FAQ PAGE:
#
#   Q: Is there a typical number for the spin-up time or does it change from case to case?
#
#   A: Typically the model requires anywhere between 6-12 hours to fully spin up. It
#      will depend on the grid distances and time steps. The finer the grid size, the
#      more time steps you would have in a given time window, hence faster spin-up.
#      You may calculate the kinetic energy spectra at various model times to see how
#      the model spins up (see Skamarock, W. C., 2004: Evaluating mesoscale NWP models
#      using kinetic energy spectra. Mon. Wea. Rev., 132, 3019-3032). You may also
#      compute d(surface pressure)/dt to see how the values settle down in time by
#      turning on the option diag_print. One way to shorten the spin up time is to
#      use digital filter initialization.
#
# PROCURED FROM THE ARW USERS GUIDE:
#
#   "Digital filter initialization (DFI) is a way to remove initial model imbalance as,
#    for example, measured by the surface pressure tendency. This might be important
#    when one is interested in the 0-6 hour simulation or forecast. It runs a digital
#    filter during a short model integration, backward and forward, and then starts the
#    simulation. In the WRF, this is all done in a single job."
#
#    NOTE: You can not use DFI with fdda analysis or spectral nudging because bad things
#          will happen to good simulations, like yours.
#
#    Info:  Per module_check_a_mundo.F (V3.7) The DFI option does NOT work with TEMF PBL

#  OPTION:  DFI_OPT  - Defines the type of DFI to use
#
#  VALUES:
#
#       0 - No DFI will be used
#       1 - Digital filter launch (DFL)
#       2 - Diabatic DFI (DDFI)
#       3 - Twice DFI (TDFI)
#
#  NOTES:  Twice DFI (3) is the recommended option
#
#  DEFAULT: DFI_OPT = 0 (Off)
#
DFI_OPT = 3


#  OPTION:  DFI_NFILTER defined the digital filter type to use.
#
#  VALUES:
#
#       0 - Uniform
#       1 - Lanczos
#       2 - Hamming
#       3 - Blackman
#       4 - Kaiser
#       5 - Potter
#       6 - Dolph window
#       7 - Dolph
#       8 - Recursive high-order
#
#  NOTES:  Dolph (7) comes highly recommended
#
#  DEFAULT: DFI_NFILTER = 7
#
DFI_NFILTER = 7



#  OPTION:  TIME_STEP_DFI
#
#     Set TIME_STEP_DFI (whole seconds) to the timestep you wish to use during
#     the DFI portion of simulation. This value should be appropriate for your
#     primary ARW domain and follow the same rules as those used to select a
#     time step used for the main simulation, which is based on the grid spacing.
#
#     Leaving TIME_STEP_DFI blank or commented out will result in the primary
#     simulation time step being used.  This is what you probably want anyway
#     but you have the power to change it.
#
#     If you are planning on using DFI with adaptive timestep during the simu-
#     lation and leave TIME_STEP_DFI blank or commented out, a value of 5*DX
#     will be assigned to TIME_STEP_DFI.
#
#  DEFAULT: TIME_STEP_DFI = (blank)
#
TIME_STEP_DFI = 


#   Options:  DFI_BACKSTOP and DFI_FWDSTOP
#
#     DFI_BACKSTOP and DFI_FWDSTOP are the number of minutes over which to do
#     the backwards and forward portion of the DFI integration respectively.
#
#     The recommended value is 40 minutes hour for DFI_BACKSTOP and 20 minutes
#     for DFI_FWDSTOP.
#
#  DEFAULTS: DFI_BACKSTOP = 40, DFI_FWDSTOP = 20
#
DFI_BACKSTOP = 40
DFI_FWDSTOP = 20


#  OPTION:  DFI_WRITE_FILTERED_INPUT - Write out filtered initial model state
#
#  VALUES:

#  DEFAULT: DFI_WRITE_DFI_HISTORY = F
#

#  OPTION:  DFI_CUTOFF_SECONDS - Cutoff period, in seconds, for the filter
#
#  VALUES:  Be reasonable and think in 30 minute periods
