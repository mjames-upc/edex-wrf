# THE UEMS LAND OF MISFIT PARAMETERS CONFIGURATION FILE
# ==============================================================================================
#
# SO WHAT DOES THIS CONFIGURATION FILE DO FOR ME?
#
#   For most users - Nothing, Nada, Bupkis, Zilch
#
#   The primary purpose of this file is to allow UEMS users the option of including an
#   alternative WRF namelist (namelist.input) to the version dynamically, yet lovingly,
#   generated from the configuration files found in this directory.
#
#   In addition, this file allows users to override individual namelist file settings,
#   the details for which can be found below.

#
#
#  OPTION:  ALT_NAMELIST
#
#      ALT_NAMELIST defines the namelist file to use as an alternative to the one
#      dynamically generated by the UEMS with the parameter values mined from the various
#      configuration files.  Should you desire to use this option, note that:
#
#        1.  Give the namelist file a name other than "namelist.wrfm" since
#            that name is reserved for UEMS use.
#
#        2.  You can specify the full path to the namelist file of just a filename.
#            If you provide just a filename it must be located in the  <domain>/static
#            directory.
#
#        3.  You are responsible for making sure the file configuration is correct
#            because no error checking will be done. Consequently, a file that worked
#            with one UEMS/WRF release may not work with another due to changes in the
#            WRF namelist parameter registry.  You can always try though.
#
#        4.  If you are here for the "full HRRR experience", then set:
#
#               ALT_NAMELIST = <path>/uems/data/tables/wrf/namelists/namelist.hrrr
#
#
#  DEFAULT: leave ALT_NAMELIST blank or commented out and let the UEMS work its magic
#           because that's what it likes to do, magic, with smoke and mirrors too.
#           And bunnies. Lots and Lots of bunnies.
#
ALT_NAMELIST =



#  OPTION:  SECTION:PARAMETER
#
#      User's may also override individual WRF namelist parameters or even add new
#      ones by including them below.  Anything you enter in this section will be
#      included in the final namelist file used for the simulation, with minimal
#      error and compatibility checking. It will be assumed that you know what
#      you are doing.
#
#      You may list as many parameters as you wish by using the following
#      convention:
#
#        SECTION:PARAMETER = VALUES
#
#      Where:
#
#        SECTION    - Is the name of the section where the parameter applies such as
#                     time_control, domains, physics. Make sure that you specify the
#                     section name correctly.
#
#        PARAMETER  - The name of the parameter you wish to include/override such as
#                     debug_level, mp_physics, spec_exp, nio_tasks_per_group. There
#                     are just so many from which to choose!  Again, note the correct
#                     spelling.
#
#        VALUES     - Contain a (comma separated) list of values that you wish to assign
#                     to the parameter. It's up to you to get them correct.
#
#     The SECTION and PARAMETER settings are not case sensitive, upper and/or lower
#     case is fine.
#
#     For example:
#
#        PHYSICS:mp_physics = 2,4,4  (not that this is recommended, which it isn't)
#
#     You may include as many "SECTION:PARAMETER = VALUES"s as you like in this file.
#
#     Finally, If you specify an alternative namelist with the ALT_NAMELIST option
#     above, then ALL the parameter override entries below will be ignored. The UEMS
#     Overlord does not appreciate humor or funny people!
