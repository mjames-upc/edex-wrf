#  CONFIGURATION: WRF PLANETARY BOUNDARY LAYER (BL_PBL_PHYSICS) PHYSICS CONFIGURATION
#
#  NOTE: Please read "run_physics_configuration.README" to learn how the configuration works
# ==============================================================================================
#
#    The purpose of a planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme is to distribute surface fluxes
#    via boundary layer eddy fluxes and allow for PBL growth by entrainment. The PBL schemes
#    are also responsible for vertical diffusion due to turbulence above the PBL.
#
#    Using a PBL scheme assumed that PBL eddies are not resolved but that assumption begins to
#    break down when dx << 1km (or dz < dx). When dx << 1km, 3D diffusion (DIFF_OPT = 2) may be
#    used instead of PBL but that option works best when dx and dz are similar, which is not
#    not often the case.
#
#    There are two classes of PBL schemes:
#
#      1. Turbulent kinetic energy prediction (MYJ, MYNN, B-L, TEMF, QNSE, CAM UW)
#
#           *  Solve for TKE in each column (Buoyancy and shear, dissipation, vertical mixing)
#           *  TKE and length^Bscale are used to determine the Kv for local vertical mixing
#           *  Schemes differ most in diagnostic length-scale computations
#           *  Should be used when model layers close to surface are close together
#
#      2. Diagnostic non-local closure (YSU, GFS, MRF, ACM2, Shin-Hong)
#
#           *  Diagnose a PBL Top
#           *  Specify a K profile
#           *  YSU, MRF, GFS include a non-gradient term (gamma)
#           *  ACM2, TEMF, EDMF include a mass-fluz profile (M) M, which is an additional updraft flux
#           *  For the ACM2, MRF, GFS schemes, the lowest full model level should be 0.990 or 0.995,
#             i.e., not too close to 1.0 (surface)
#
#
#    Note that since there must be a match between the PBL and the surface layer scheme, the
#    PBL scheme requested will automatically define the surface layer scheme used.
#
#
#    SIMULATIONS 1KM BELOW
#
#    Unless you plan on running a Large Eddy Simulation (LES), you should keep using a PBL
#    scheme between 1km and 500m. Remember that you can not use a different PBL scheme
#    in a child domain from that of its parent; however, you CAN turn the PBL scheme OFF
#    in a child domain.  Additionally, consider using the Shin-Hong 'scale-aware' PBL scheme
#    (BL_PBL_PHYSICS = 11), which is designed for sub 1km grid scales.
#
#    While it is possible to nest down to an LES (sub 400m DX) at which grid scale you can
#    turn OFF the PBL scheme (BL_PBL_PHYSICS = X,X,0; where X = PBL scheme); however, you
#    must take care that all the other physics configuration settings are appropriate for
#    such a simulation.  For example, since you cannot change MP schemes across a domain,
#    you will likely have to use a scheme designed for high resolution runs for all
#    domains.  Additionally, the PBL scheme you choose for the non LES domains must use
#    a surface layer scheme (sf_sfclay_physics) that is compatible with an LES (1 or 2),
#    which (as of this writing) is BL_PBL_PHYSICS = 1,2,5,6,7,8,9,11, & 12, and just to
#    play it safe set SF_SFCLAY_PHYSICS = 1.
#
#    Note that the UEMS will attempt to reconcile your configuration values but it's not
#    perfect (you didn't read this). Accidents do happen and simulations explode. Just
#    don't let it happen to you.
#
#    If you choose to turn the PBL scheme OFF (LES) then make sure to set the following below:
#
#       a. sf_surface_physics    (pick a nice non-zero option)
#       b. sf_sfclay_physics = 1 (automatically set if bl_pbl_physics = 0 in domain list)
#       c. Either:
#            sfflx = 1       (recommended - drag and heat flux from physics - see below)
#          or
#            sfflx = 2       (drag and heat flux from tke_drag_coefficient and tke_heat_flux)
#       d. diff_opt = 2       (Recommended - in run_dynamics.conf)
#       e. km_opt = 2 or 3    (Recommended - in run_dynamics.conf)
#       f. mix_isotropic = 1  (Automatically set)
#       g. diff_6th_opt = 2   (Recommended - in run_dynamics.conf)
#       g. through y. Make sure physics schemes are appropriate
#
#
#    Using something other than the suggested settings above may require modifications to the
#    ems_run routine.
#
#
#    The current BL_PBL_PHYSICS options include (MAX DOMAINS):
#
#       0 - No planetary boundary layer scheme for you! You get your eddies elsewhere.
#
#           Actually what you get is an LES simulation but you will still have to select
#           a surface physics scheme. See the comment above.

#           of Troen and Mahrt (1986) and further described by Hong and Pan (1996).
#           The PBL height is determined by an iterative bulk-Richardson approach

#           coefficient is specified as a cubic function of height. Coefficient values
#           are obtained by matching the surface-layer fluxes. A counter-gradient flux
#           parameterization is included. Used operationally at NCEP.

#
#           Note:  This PBL scheme also includes a shallow convective option, which, when
#                 activated, means that you are running QNSE-EDMF, where the EDMF stands
#                 Eddy Daytime Mass Flux (At least I thinks its "Eddy") The shallow CU
#                 option is turned OFF when SHCU_PHYSICS = 0, and turned ON (mfshconv = 1)
#                 when SHCU_PHYSICS = -1 unless a CU_PHYSICS option is selected that
#                 also incorporates the effects of shallow convection that can not be
#                 turned off.
#
#           Info:  The QNSE PBL scheme can not be used with the scale-aware KF cumulus
