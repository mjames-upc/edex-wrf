#  CONFIGURATION: LAND-SURFACE MODEL (SF_SURFACE_PHYSICS) PHYSICS CONFIGURATION
#
#  NOTE: Please read "run_physics_configuration.README" to learn how the configuration works
# ==============================================================================================
#
#    The SF_SURFACE_PHYSICS parameter defined the land-surface model (LSM) to use when running
#    a simulation. The scheme handles many of the complex atmospheric processes near the surface
#    including the prediction of:
#
#      a. Soil temperature and moisture
#      b. Snow water equivalent on ground
#      c. Canopy moisture & temperature
#      d. Vegetation and soil processes
#      e. Some urban effects
#
#    Note that your choice of LSM will be influenced by the land surface/use dataset
#    used during localization:
#
#                 LSM Physics                             Land Use Dataset
#    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#      Thermal Diffusion LSM (SF_SURFACE_PHYSICS = 1) | USGS and USGS+lakes
#      Unified Noah LSM      (SF_SURFACE_PHYSICS = 2) | USGS, USGS+lakes, MODIS, and MODIS+lakes
#      RUC LSM               (SF_SURFACE_PHYSICS = 3) | USGS, USGS+lakes, MODIS, and MODIS+lakes
#      Unified MP Noah LSM   (SF_SURFACE_PHYSICS = 4) | USGS, USGS+lakes, MODIS, and MODIS+lakes
#      Community Land Model  (SF_SURFACE_PHYSICS = 5) | USGS (no lakes)
#      Pleim-Xiu LSM         (SF_SURFACE_PHYSICS = 7) | MODIS, USGS (no lakes), NLCD2006, and NLCD2011
#      SSiB LSM              (SF_SURFACE_PHYSICS = 8) | USGS (no lakes), SSIB
#    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#    If you don't know which dataset was used then run "ems_domain --info" from the domain
#    directory and look the output.
#
#
#    The current SF_SURFACE_PHYSICS options include (MAX DOMAINS):
#
#       0 - No surface temperature prediction
#
#       1 - 5-layer thermal diffusion: Soil temperature only scheme that uses five
#           layers. Hence the name (Skamarock et al, 2005). Thermal properties depend
#           on land use. No soil moisture or snow-cover prediction. Moisture availability
#           depends on land-use only. Additional configuration option IFSNOW available
#           in the ancillary options section at the bottom of this file.
#
#       2 - NOAH Land Surface Model: Unified NCEP/NCAR/AFWA scheme with soil temperature
#           and moisture in four layers, fractional snow cover, and frozen soil physics.
#           Vegetation effects included. Predicts snow cover and canopy moisture. Diagnoses
#           skin temperature ans uses emissivity. Provided heat and moisture fluxes to
#           the PBL. (Chen and Dudhia, 2001). This option is the best choice if you are post-
#           processing your forecast files with the UEMS.
#
#             *  A new sub-tiling option introduced in V3.6. See SF_SURFACE_MOSAIC
#                and MOSIAC_CAT options below.
#
#       3 - RUC Land Surface Model: The RUC operational scheme with soil temperature and
#           moisture in six layers, multi-layer snow and frozen soil physics. The possibility
#           exists for 9 soil moisture and temperature layers if you are the daring type, which
#           I already know you are.   Includes many of the NOAH Land Surface Model options.
#           Used in the operational HRRR & RAP. (Smirnove et al. 1997, 2000).
#
#             *  Default is 6 soil layers see RUC_NUM_SOIL_LEVELS below to change to 9
#
#             *  If RUC LSM is used, MOSAIC_LU & MOSAIC_SOIL are automatically set to 1
#                in the UEMS.
#
#
#       4 - Noah-MP (multi-physics) Land Surface Model: uses multiple options for key land-
#           atmosphere interaction processes. Noah-MP contains a separate vegetation canopy
#           defined by a canopy top and bottom with leaf physical and radiometric properties
#           used in a two-stream canopy radiation transfer scheme that includes shading effects.
#           Noah-MP contains a multi-layer snow pack with liquid water storage and melt/refreeze
#           capability and a snow-interception model describing loading/unloading, melt/refreeze,
#           and sublimation of the canopy-intercepted snow. Multiple OPTIONS available for
#           surface water infiltration and runoff, and groundwater transfer and storage including
#           water table depth to an unconfined aquifer. Horizontal and vertical vegetation density
#           can be prescribed or predicted using prognostic photosynthesis and dynamic vegetation
#           models that allocate carbon to vegetation (leaf, stem, wood and root) and soil carbon
#           pools (fast and slow).
#
#
#       5 - CLM4 (Community Land Model Version 4): CLM4 was developed at the National Center for
#           Atmospheric Research with many external collaborators and represents a state-of-the-
#           science land surface process model. It contains sophisticated treatment of biogeophysics,
#           hydrology, biogeochemistry, and dynamic vegetation. In CLM4, the land surface in each
#           model grid cell is characterized into five primary sub-grid land cover types (glacier,
#           lake, wetland, urban, and vegetated). The vegetated sub-grid consists of up to 4 plant
#           functional types (PFTs) that differ in physiology and structure. The WRF input land
#           cover types are translated into the CLM4 PFTs through a look-up table. The CLM4
#           vertical structure includes a single-layer vegetation canopy, a five-layer snowpack,
#           and a ten layer soil column.
#
#
#           Highlights:
#                       *  10-level soil, 5-level snow
#                       *  Sub-grid tiling
#                       *  CESM land component
#                       *  Further capabilities not activated: dynamic vegetation (AKA "Chia Pet" Parameterization),
#                          lake model, carbon-nitrogen cycle
#
#           NOTES:
#                       *  Does not work with any Urban Canopy Model (SF_URBAN_PHYSICS)
#                       *  Must be using USGS (24) or MODIS (20/21) Land Categories
#                       *  Does not work with MYJ PBL - Per module_surface_driver.F
#
#                    ***!  As good as the CLM4 may be, it will bring your simulation to a crawl!
#
#           An earlier version of CLM has been quantitatively evaluated within WRF in Jin and
#           Wen (2012; JGR-Atmosphere), Lu and Kueppers (2012; JGR-Atmosphere), and Subin et al.
#           (2011; Earth Interactions) (from Jin).
#
#       7 - Pleim-Xiu Land Surface Model (EPA): A two-layer scheme with vegetation and
#           sub-grid tilting. Includes simple snow-cover model. Users should recognize that
#           the PX LSM was primarily developed for retrospective simulations, where surface-
#           based observations are available to inform the indirect soil nudging. While it
#           may be run without soil nudging, little testing has been done in this mode,
#           although some users have reported reasonable results. UEMS users have
#           encountered problems when using the PX LSM without surface nudging.
#
#           NOTES:
#                       *  Works with MODIS, USGS, NLCD2006, and NLCD2011 land use datasets.
#
#
#
#       8 - SSiB Land Surface Model: This is the third generation of the Simplified
#           Simple Biosphere Model (Xue et al. 1991; Sun and Xue, 2001). SSiB is developed
#           for land/atmosphere interaction studies in the climate model. The aerodynamic
#           resistance values in SSiB are determined in terms of vegetation properties,
#           ground conditions and bulk Richardson number according to the modified Monin–
#           Obukhov similarity theory. SSiB-3 includes three snow layers to realistically
#           simulate snow processes, including destructive metamorphism, densification
#           process due to snow load, and snow melting, which substantially enhances the
#           model’s ability for the cold season study.
#
#           To use this option, ra_lw_physics and ra_sw_physics must be set to 1, 3, or 4
#           and the fractional seaice option must be turned ON (fractional_seaice = 1);
#           however, use of the SSiB model with fractional_seaice is not documented
#           anywhere except within the model code, so Caveat Emptor!
#
#           Additionally, the second full model level should be set to no larger than
#           0.982 so that the height of that level is higher than vegetation height.
#
#           IMPORTANT:
#
#           The SSIB LSM is designed to work with the SSIB land use dataset but may
#           also be used with USGS. These datasets are specified during the creation of
#           the computational domain. Since the default is MODIS, you may need to re-
#           localize your domain with "ems_domain" and passing "--landuse ssib".
#
#           And if the above is not enough, SSiB MUST be used with a PBL scheme, so no
#           LES or cloud-scale simulations with the SSiB.
#
#           ONCE AGAIN:
#
#             a. The SSiB scheme only works with:
#
#                *  LW & SW radiation schemes - RRTM (1), CAM (3), or RRTMG (4)
#                *  PBL Scheme - YSU (1)
#                *  Surface Layer Scheme - Monin-Obukhov (1)  (Set automatically)
#                *  Fractional Sea Ice ON (Set automatically)
#
#             b. The second full model level above ground, 1.0 being the first, must be
#                equal or smaller than 0.982 (0.979 is OK, 0.985 is not OK), which means
#                you will likely have to manually set the LEVELS parameter in run_levels.conf.
#                This is because SSiB requires that this level be above the vegetation
#                height. A 28-level example might look like:
#
#                LEVELS = 1.000, 0.982, 0.973, 0.964, 0.946, 0.922, 0.894, 0.860, 0.817, 0.766,
#                         0.707, 0.644, 0.576, 0.507, 0.444, 0.380, 0.324, 0.273, 0.228, 0.188,
#                         0.152, 0.121, 0.093, 0.069, 0.048, 0.029, 0.014, 0.000
#
#
#   The NOAH and RUC schemes above require that soil moisture and temperature fields be available
#   in the initialization dataset. It is also best that the type of LSM scheme be consistent with
#   the dataset used for initialization. So use the RAP initialization dataset with the RAP LSM
#   and the NAM/GFS/NNRP with the NOAH LSM. Finally, spin-up issues may occur if static surface
#   datasets, such as the land-use, soil texture, are inconsistent between initialization dataset
#   and LSM scheme, but this may be unavoidable.
