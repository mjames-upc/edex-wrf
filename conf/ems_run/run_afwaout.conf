# THE UEMS AFWA DIAGNOSTICS CONFIGURATION FILE
# ==============================================================================================
#
# SO WHAT DOES THIS CONFIGURATION FILE DO FOR ME?
#
#   Below you will find parameters that control the output of additional fields
#   contributed by AFWA. These fields include stability, precipitation type,
#   reflectivity, and turbulence diagnostics, as well as some others. Not all
#   of the AFWA fields are output in the UEMS as some were determined to be
#   duplicates of existing fields or cause problems while writing out the
#   netCDF file. Consequently, you get the best of the rest.
#
#  OK - SINCE YOU ASKED NICELY, HERE'S THE ENTIRE LIST:

#  NOTE:  There is some duplication of fields between the AFWA and UEMS diagnostics.
#
#  ADDITIONAL FOOD FOR THOUGHT:  Some fields, such as MSLP, are already calculated as part
#                                of the post processing by EMSUPP.
#
#  ADDITIONAL THOUGHT FOR FOOD:  I'm hungry

#  Available for everybody - All AFWA output is in netCDF format!
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#

#  OPTION:  AUXHIST2_INTERVAL (NESTED) - Output Frequency of the AFWA diagnostic fields
#
#  VALUES:  The AUXHIST2_INTERVAL parameter specifies the frequency, in minutes,
#           of the AFWA diagnostic fields for each domain. For example, if
#           AUXHIST2_INTERVAL = 60, then the data are output hourly. If
#           AUXHIST2_INTERVAL = 30, then the fields are dumped every 30 minutes.
#
#           If AUXHIST2_INTERVAL = Auto, then the AFWA fields are output at the
#           same frequency as the primary simulation output.
#
#  NOTES:   Output of these data is turned OFF if AFWA_DIAG_OPT = 0
#           or AUXHIST2_INTERVAL = 0
#
#  DEFAULTS: AUXHIST2_INTERVAL = Auto
#
AUXHIST2_INTERVAL = 0


#  OPTION:  FRAMES_PER_AUXHIST2 - The number of output times per file
#
#  VALUES:  Typically, a user would want FRAMES_PER_AUXHIST2 = 1, which
#           is one forecast time per file, or FRAMES_PER_AUXHIST2 > = total
#           number of output times, if the user wants all times written to
#           a single monolithic file. You could also do something else if
#           your heart desires, but don't.
#
#  DEFAULTS: FRAMES_PER_AUXHIST2 = 1
#
FRAMES_PER_AUXHIST2 = 1


# ==============================================================================================
#  ANCILLARY CONFIGURATION SETTINGS YOU PROBABLY DO NOT NEED TO WORRY ABOUT
# ==============================================================================================
#

#  OPTION:  AUXHIST2_NAMEKEY - AFWA diagnostics filename key
#
#  VALUES:  The AUXHIST2_NAMEKEY parameter is a string that will be used to complete
#           the naming convention for the AFWA diagnostics fields.  All files will
#           name the convention of "<outname>_d<domain>_<date>"; however, you will
#           be able to replace the "<outname>" with the string defined by the
#           AUXHIST2_NAMEKEY parameter.
#
#  NOTES:   It is recommended that you leave well enough along and go pick on
#           another configuration file. Changing AUXHIST2_NAMEKEY from the default
#           may cause the UEMS post processing to fail since the routines key on
#           these strings.
#
#  DEFAULTS: AUXHIST2_NAMEKEY = afwa
#
AUXHIST2_NAMEKEY = afwa
