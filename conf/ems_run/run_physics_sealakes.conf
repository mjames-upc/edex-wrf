#
# IMPORTANT USER INFORMATION - Read on if you dare
#
#  This file contains the parameters necessary to configure a simulation that
#  requires special sea ice & ocean physics. For most users, editing the
#  default settings in this file will not be necessary as your efforts are
#  probably best served somewhere else.  For the few of you wishing to simulate
#  the sinking of the Titanic, then may all your icebergs float right-side up.
#
#  Most, if not all, of the information contained in this file was liberated
#  from various WRF documents so the original author should get all the credit,
#  whomever that person may be. If you are unable to locate that person then
#  feel free to send some thanks my way and I'll pass it along.

#  CONFIGURATION: OCEAN MIXED LAYER MODEL PHYSICS OPTIONS
#
#  OPTION:  SF_OCEAN_PHYSICS - Activate ocean mixed layer model options
#
#  VALUES:
#
#     0 - Ocean mixed layer model is OFF
#
#     1 - Simple ocean mixed layer model (Previously OMLCALL = 1)
#
#         This is a 1-D ocean mixed layer model following that of Pollard, Rhines
#         and Thompson (1972). Includes wind-driven ocean mixing. Works with all
#         sf_surface_physics options.
#
#         Note that the only thing the oml model responds to is strong surface winds,
#         such as hurricane strength, and it can result in some cooling due to upward
#         It is not intended for lakes.
#
#
#         Uses:
#               oml_hml0  - initial ocean mixed layer depth
#               oml_gamma - lapse rate in deep water below mixed layer
#
#     2 - Use 3D Price-Weller-Pinkel (PWP) ocean model
#
#         This model predicts horizontal advection, pressure gradient force, as well
#         as mixed layer processes. Only simple initialization via variables ocean_z,
#         ocean_t, and ocean_s is available.
#
#         Only works with sf_surface_physics = 1 (5-Layer slab soil temperature scheme)
#
#         Uses:
#               ocean_levels - number of vertical levels in 3D PWP
#               ocean_z      - depth of levels
#               ocean_t      - temperature of levels
#               ocean_s      - salinity of levels
#               omdt         - PWP time step
#
#         NOTE:  The Price-Weller-Pinkel option (2) is not currently supported by the UEMS
#                due to the fact that the user (you) must manually specify ocean_levels,
#                ocean_z, ocean_t, and ocean_s.  This option will be activated in the UEMS
#                once Pinkel comes up with a better initialization method.
#
#  DEFAULT: SF_OCEAN_PHYSICS = 0
#
SF_OCEAN_PHYSICS = 0


#  OPTION:  OML_HML0 - Initial ocean mixed layer depth value (m)
#
#  NOTES:   The value of OML_HML0 defines the initial depth of the simple ocean mixed layer
#           model in meters.
#
#           Only used when SF_OCEAN_PHYSICS = 1
#
#  DEFAULT: OML_HML0 = 50. (meters)
#
OML_HML0 = 50.


#  OPTION:  OML_GAMMA - Lapse rate (K m-1) in deep water (below the mixed layer)
#
#           Only used when SF_OCEAN_PHYSICS = 1
#
#  DEFAULT: OML_GAMMA = 0.14 (K m-1)
#
OML_GAMMA = 0.14

#  CONFIGURATION: SST SKIN TEMPERATURE PHYSICS OPTIONS
# ==============================================================================================
#

#  OPTION:  SST_SKIN - calculate skin SST based on Zeng and Beljaars (2005)
#
#  VALUES:
#
#       0 - Calculation of SST skin temperatures is OFF
#       1 - Calculation of SST skin temperatures is ON
#
#  NOTES:  The SST_SKIN parameter to used to allow the water points in the
#          simulation to respond to a simple radiative (diurnal) forcing
#          based on Zeng and Beljaars (2005). The documentation states that
#          it is useful for multi-year runs but it's a DIURNAL cycle, so
#          why not use it for any simulation?
#
#  DEFAULT: SST_SKIN = 0 (OFF)
#
SST_SKIN = 0


#  OPTION:  SST_UPDATE - Time-varying sea-surface temperature
#
#  VALUES:
#
#       0 - Time-varying sea-surface temperature is OFF
#       1 - Time-varying sea-surface temperature is ON
#
#  NOTES:  The WRF model physics does not predict sea-surface temperature,
#          vegetation fraction, albedo and sea ice. For long simulations,
#          the model provides an alternative to read-in the time-varying
#          data and update these fields. In order to use this option,
#          one must have access to time-varying SST and sea ice fields
#          and then process the data as part of your initialization and
#          boundary condition datasets.
#
#  DEFAULT: SST_UPDATE = 0 (OFF)
#
SST_UPDATE = 0

#  CONFIGURATION: LAKE MODEL CONFIGURATION STUFF
# ==============================================================================================
#

#  OPTION:  SF_LAKE_PHYSICS - Activate lake model options
#
#  VALUES:
#
#       0 - Lake Model is OFF
#       1 - Simple lake model turned ON
#
#  NOTES:   The lake model is a one-dimensional mass and energy balance scheme with 20-25
#           model layers, including up to 5 snow layers on the lake ice, 10 water layers,
#           and 10 soil layers on the lake bottom. The lake scheme is used with actual lake
#           points and lake depth derived from the WPS, and it also can be used with user-
#           defined lake points and lake depth in WRF (lake_min_elev and lakedepth_default).
#
#           The lake scheme is independent of a land surface scheme and therefore can be used
#           with any land surface scheme embedded in WRF. The lake scheme developments and
#           evaluations were included in Subin et al. (2012) and Gu et al. (2013).
#
#           ! If you are thinking of using this physics scheme then make you re-localize your
#             domain with the "--lakes" flag, i.e., "% ems_domain --localize --lakes".
#
#
#  DEFAULT:  SF_LAKE_PHYSICS = 0 (OFF)
#
SF_LAKE_PHYSICS = 0


#  OPTION:  LAKEDEPTH_DEFAULT - Default lake depth in meters
#
#  NOTES:   If there is no lake_depth information in the input data, then lake
#           depth is assumed to be 50m. Data is available through GEOGRID when
#           localizing a domain.
#
#  DEFAULT: LAKEDEPTH_DEFAULT = 50.
#
LAKEDEPTH_DEFAULT = 50


#  OPTION:  LAKE_MIN_ELEV - Minimum elevation of lakes in meters
#
#  NOTES:   May be used to determine whether a water point is a lake in the absence of lake
#           category. If the landuse type includes 'lake' (i.e. Modis_lake and USGS_LAKE),
#           this variable is of no effects.
#
#  DEFAULT: LAKE_MIN_ELEV = 5.
#
LAKE_MIN_ELEV = 5.


#  OPTION:  USE_LAKEDEPTH - Option to use lake depth data
#
#  NOTES:   If one didn't process the lake depth data, but this switch is set to 1, the
#           program will stop and you will be disappointed.
#
#  VALUES:
#
#       0 - Do not use lake depth data
#       1 - Use lake depth data
#
#  DEFAULT:  USE_LAKEDEPTH = 1 (Use it)
#
USE_LAKEDEPTH = 0
