# WRF 3D ANALYSIS & SPECTRAL NUDGING CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================================================================
#
# SO WHAT DOES THIS CONFIGURATION FILE DO FOR ME?
#
#   For most users - Nothing, Nada, Bupkis, Zilch
#
#   This file is used for the configuration 3D Analysis or Spectral Nudging as
#   part of a WRF simulation. Nudging can be useful for some types of retro-
#   spective simulations and regional climatology studies by reducing the
#   amount of forecast "drift" or error during model integration.
#
#   For studies that involve the dissection of model forcing it is recommended
#   that nudging NOT be applied to any domains directly involved in the
#   analysis. For example, if you are running a simulation with 2 nested sub-
#   domains and plan on using only the inner-most nest in the research, then
#   turn OFF nudging for that domain. This is because the inclusion of nudging
#   introduces additional (non-physical) forcing into the model atmosphere
#   that you would have to explain, and you really don't want to go there.
#
#   If you are running a nested simulation with 3D nudging, then you should
#   also consider turning 2-way feedback OFF in run_nests.conf (FEEDBACK = 0).
#
#   Nudging will not be used during a simulation unless either the "--nudge"
#   flag is passed to ems_run or the NUDGING parameter is set in ems_autorun.conf;
#   otherwise, the contents of this file will be ignored.
#
#   Also important: If nudging is requested the default behavior is to turn
#   ON nudging for the primary domain (Domain 1) ONLY over the entire length
#   of the simulation unless otherwise specified by the NUDGING setting below.
#
#   Here are the rules:
#
#     0. If you want to do any sort of nudging during a simulation, you must
#        also pass the --nudge flag when running ems_prep. This flag requests
#        that the required nudging fields be created from the initialization
#        datasets. No "ems_prep --nudge", NO nudging love!
#
#     1. Turning nudging ON in ems_run requires either:
#
#            a. Passing of  the --nudge flag to ems_run
#        Or
#            b. Setting NUDGING = Yes (or 1) in ems_autorun.conf (for ems_autorun)
#
#        Otherwise, this file is ignored and NO nudging will happen for you. You
#        like your simulations straight without the embellishments.
#
#     2. Passing "--nudge" to ems_run WITHOUT arguments or setting NUDGING = Yes
#        in ems_autorun.conf (when running ems_autorun) will turn ON nudging for
#        those domains specified in the NUDGING parameter below. In the absence
#        of a NUDGING value, nudging will by done for the primary domain only
#        over the entire length of the simulation.
#
#     3. Passing "--nudge" to ems_run WITH arguments, either 1 or 2, overrides
#        the GRID_FDDA parameter (Nudging Method) below. Passing anything other
#        than --nudge 1 or 2 will default back to the GRID_FDDA value.
#
#     4. There is an entire Appendix dedicated to nudging in the UEMS user guide.
#
#    Finally, to reduce user confusion and screw-ups, some WRF nudging parameters
#    are set internally by the UEMS since there is limited reason for the values
#    to deviate from the default values.
#
#    NOTE:  You can not use analysis or spectral nudging with DFI because
#           bad things will happen to good simulations, like yours
#
#    ALSO:  See the UEMS user guide for additional and sometimes gory details.

#  OPTION:   NUDGING  - Does a lot so pay attention
#
#  WORKS LIKE:
#
#       NUDGING = <domain #:length in hours from T0>,...,<domain #N:length in hours from T0>
#
#
#    NUDGING defines the domains on which to conduct 3D nudging (analysis|spectral)
#    during the simulation. By now you should understand that any domains listed
#    must have been created when defining your computational domain.
#
#    SILLY NOTE: You must be sure that you are actually including each domain specified
#                in NUDGING below in your simulation.
#
#    The convention for DOMAIN is:
#
#      NUDGING = <domain number>:<length of nudging period in hours from simulation start>
#
#    Where:
#          <domain number> = Domain number 1..N (easy enough). Why include Domain 1 in
#                            the list when it's included by default? Well, there are
#                            times when you might want to turn OFF (ramp down) analysis
#                            nudging for domain 1 before the end of a simulation.
#
#          <period length> = Length of the nudging period in hours from the start of
#                            model (not nest) integration (T0). If the period extends
#                            beyond the end of model integration for a given domain
#                            nudging will terminate when the model stops (obviously).
#
#                            If you start a nested domain at a later time than its
#                            parent (see ems_prep) the nudging period STILL STARTS
#                            with model integration. Consequently, the period length
#                            is only used to define the time at which nudging is turned
#                            OFF.
#
#                            It is important that the period length be an integer
#                            multiple of the interval between analysis times. If you
#                            are using 3-hourly analyses then the length must be 3
#                            (hours) x N, where 3N is less than or equal to the
#                            simulation length. Failure to follow this simple request
#                            will result in your period being adjusted, which might hurt.
#
#
#    For example, if you created 5 nested domains, identified as 01...05 (domain 01
#    is the parent of all domains) and you want to turn ON nudging for domains
#    1,2, and 4, but not 5 then set NUDGING = 1,2,3,4.
#
#    Note that if you turn nudging ON then you also should include the parent domain.
#    Thus, if domain 3 is a child of 2, and you want to nudge domain 3 you will need
#    to nudge domain 2 as well. Conversely, if you nudge domain 2 then domain 3 does
#    not have to be nudged.
#
#    Again, the "period" of nudging begins with the start of domain 1 integration.
#
#    Examples:
#
#      NUDGING = 2:12 - Terminate analysis nudging on domain 2 twelve hours after the start of
#                       model integration. Nudging on domain 1 will be included by default and
#                       run through the end of the simulation.
#
#      NUDGING = 1:12,3:9 - Terminate analysis nudging on domain one 12 hours after the start
#                           of integration. Stop nudging on domain 3 nine hours after the
#                           model start. If domain 2, which is not included, is the parent of
#                           domain 3 then it will also be included and nudging will be
#                           conducted on domain 2 from the start of integration to the end
#                           of domain 1 nudging.
#
#                           If the 9 hour nudging period for domain 3 extends beyond the end
#                           of nudging on domain 2, then it will be terminated with domain 2.

#  Nudging Method Configuration - Analysis or Spectral Nudging
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  OPTION: GRID_FDDA - Nudging Method
#
#     The WRF allows users to choose between two methods of nudging, analysis or spectal.
#     In analysis nudging, each grid-point is nudged towards a value that is time-interpolated
#     from analyses. Spectral nudging is designed towards the nudging of only selected larger
#     scales, may be useful for controlling longer wave phases for long simulations.
#
#  DEFAULT:
#
#       For analysis nudging, select GRID_FDDA = 1   (Default)
#       For spectral nudging, select GRID_FDDA = 2
#
#
GRID_FDDA = 1


#  OPTION: SPWAVELEN - wavelength to nudge for spectral nudging
#
#     Should you choose to apply spectral nudging, you will have to decide which wavelengths
#     to nudge.  If you are familiar with the WRF namelist options then you will know that
#     this setting is controlled by the xwavenum & ywavenum parameters. However, since the
#     UEMS is all about making your life easier and thus affording you the opportunity to
#     slack off, a single UEMS parameter, SPWAVELEN is used for the same purpose. The
#     SPWAVELEN defines the smallest wavelength to nudge. The wavelength (in Km) should
#     be determined from the grid spacing of your initialization dataset, E.g. 0.5 deg.
#     If you assume that it requires ~ 6 to 8 grid points to adequately resolve a wave,
#     Then the minimum wavelength should be between 6 to 8 DX, E.g. 3 to 4 degrees or
#     about 300 to 450 km.  If you nudging dataset has a courser (finer) resolution then
#     you should increase (decrease) the wavelength.
#
#       SPWAVELEN = smallest wavelength to nudge (km)
#
#     The highly complex mathematical algorithm in the UEMS will calculate the values
#     of xwavenum & ywavenum from your SPWAVELEN setting and the areal coverage of your
#     computational domain.
#
#     If you leave SPWAVELEN blank, the UEMS will attempt to guess the resolution of your
#     nudging dataset to calculate some appropriate values for xwavenum & ywavenum.
#
#     Note that SPWAVELEN is ignored if GRID_FDDA = 1 (Analysis nudging)
#
#  DEFAULT: SPWAVELEN = 400
#
SPWAVELEN = 400



#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Configuration of nudging for model dependent variables
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#    So you though this was going to be easy?  Well, actually it is, provided you simply
#    close your eyes and have faith in your UEMS, in which case your nudging configuration
#    is done so just close this file and move on to running the simulation.  Otherwise,
#    if you are looking for excitement in your life and your apprenticeship as a pirate
#    off the coast of Somalia wasn't what you expected, then read on.
#
#    The parameters below control the nudging mixing ratio (Q), temperature (T), and
#    the wind components (U and V) during a simulation. The default values are those
#    recommended in the WRF documentation so you should not need to change them unless
#    you know what you are doing. But then again, that never stopped anyone from
#    signing up for pirate school before.
#
#    There are three configurable parameters for nudging each of the model dependent
#    variables and the parameters may have a different value for each domain. The
#    default settings below have a single value that is applied uniformly but should
#    you want to assign different values to each domain then simply provide individual
#    values separated by a comma (,). Any unassigned domains will get the default value.
#
#    The configurable parameters are:
#
#      g(uv|t|q)
#
#         The nudging coefficient for each variable, E.g., guv, gt, and gq. Setting
#         the parameter to 0.0 turns OFF analysis nudging for that variable. A value
#         greater than 0 turns ON nudging and applies the value.
#
#         The default value is 0.0003 (s-1), which corresponds to a timescale of
#         about 1 hour.  Doubling the value to 0.0006 gives you a timescale of about
#         30 minutes.
#
#         Note that nudging may also be turned off (g(uv|t|q) = 0.) by setting
#         setting k_zfac_(uv|t|q) = 0 below.
#
#
#      k_zfac_(uv|t|q)
#
#          Specifies the model layer below which nudging is to be turned OFF. It can
#          be advantageous to only nudge a simulation within the mid- to upper model
#          atmosphere and allow the lower tropospheric features to evolve naturally.
#
#          In this case set k_zfac_(uv|t|q) to the integer layer above which nudging
#          will be applied.  In the WRF the surface is level 1 and increases vertically.
#
#          Setting k_zfac_(uv|t|q) = 1 turns ON (uv|t|q) nudging for all layers.
#
#          Setting k_zfac_(uv|t|q) = 0 turns OFF (uv|t|q) nudging for all layers, which
#          is the same as setting g(uv|t|q) = 0.
#
#          Setting k_zfac_(uv|t|q) = 10 turns OFF (uv|t|q) nudging below model layer 10.
#
#      Note for those familiar with the FDDA WRF namelist configuration. The value provided
#      for k_zfac_(uv|t|q) will control the configuration of "if_zfac_(uv|t|q)", so don't get
#      all upset that both parameters aren't presented here.
#
#
#      if_no_pbl_nudging_(uv|t|q)
#
#          Specifies whether to turn OFF (1) or keep ON (0) nudging withing the PBL.
#          When set to 1, this parameter effectively overrides k_zfac_(uv|t|q) in cases
#          where nudging is turned ON above a layer but that layer resides within the
#          simulated PBL. The very limited documentation indicates that nudging will
#          be turned off for that layer. The recommended value is 1, which directs the
#          model to turn OFF nudging within the PBL. An exception may be made for UV;
#          otherwise, you will get a warning.
#
#          So remember: if_no_pbl_nudging_(uv|t|q) = 1 if OFF!
#

#    Parameter Settings for Temperature (T) (MAX DOMAINS)
#
GT = 0.0003
K_ZFAC_T = 1
IF_NO_PBL_NUDGING_T = 1


#    Parameter Settings for Mixing Ratio (Q) (MAX DOMAINS)
#
GQ = 0.0003
K_ZFAC_Q = 1
IF_NO_PBL_NUDGING_Q = 1

#    Parameter Settings for U and V Wind Components (UV) (MAX DOMAINS)
#
GUV = 0.0003
K_ZFAC_UV = 1
IF_NO_PBL_NUDGING_UV = 1


#  OPTION:  DTRAMP_MIN - Ramping period
#
#    The ramping period is only used when analysis nudging is turned OFF prior to the termination
#    the model simulation. Setting DTRAMP_MIN to a non-zero value will instruct the model to gradually
#    reduce the nudging over DTRAMP_MIN minutes until the nudging is turned OFF.  It is recommended
#    that DTRAMP_MIN be used in cases where  nudging is turned OFF prior to the termination of the
#    model to avoid the generation of noise as the model adjusts to a non-nudged state.
#
#    Examples of DTRAMP_MIN values include:
#
#        DTRAMP_MIN = -60. - Begin ramping down nudging 60 minutes prior to the requested nudging
#                            termination time.
#
#        DTRAMP_MIN = 0.   - Abruptly end nudging at requested time
#
#        DTRAMP_MIN = 60.  - Begin ramping down nudging at requested time and continue for 60 minutes.
#
#    DTRAMP_MIN is only used when nudging is turned OFF prior to model termination.
#
#  DEFAULT: DTRAMP_MIN = 60
#
DTRAMP_MIN = 60.
