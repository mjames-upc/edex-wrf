# THE UEMS Dataset EXPORT CONFIGURATION FILE
# ==============================================================================================
#
# SO WHAT DOES THIS CONFIGURATION FILE DO FOR ME?
#
#   Below you will find parameters that control the exporting of UEMS datasets to
#   wonderful and exotic locations, such as a workstation in another room or in
#   your basement. Please review and modify as necessary.
#
# IMPORTANT STUFF
#
#   The exporting of datasets may be selectively turned OFF from the command line
#   by using the "--noexport [matching string list]", where "matching string list"
#   is an optional comma separated list of FILE TYPEs as described below. Passing
#   "--noexport" without any arguments turn OFF all exporting of files.

#  EXPORT
#
#     If keeping the processed UEMS output files in the local "emsprd" directory is not
#     part of your genetic makeup, then the EXPORT option is the solution to all your
#     problems.  This option allows you to transfer those data files to other locations
#     whether they are on the local system or somewhere far, far away. You have control
#     over transferring multiple data formats from different domains independently via
#     FTP, Secure FTP (SFTP), COPY (CP), or secure copy (SCP). Additionally, you have
#     the option of exporting a subset of a specified dataset.  Too much power for you
#     handle?  Yah, it should be.
#
#     CAVEAT:  You must have your system correctly configured to use some of these
#              transfer methods.
#
#
#     Specifying which files go to what location and at what frequency is controlled by
#     the EXPORT parameter. The syntax or EXPORT are specified as:
#
#         EXPORT = DOMAIN NUMBER | FILE TYPE | KEY | METHOD | FREQ:START:STOP | [USER@]HOSTNAME | LOCATION
#
#     Where:
#
#         EXPORT             The keyword. You may have multiple instances of EXPORT. As many as
#                            you wish, like 799 if your heart desires. So desire it!
#
#         DOMAIN NUMBER      The DOMAIN NUMBER specifies the domain to which the EXPORT statement
#                            applies. Not including a value or using "0" will result in the
#                            statement being applied to ALL domains being processed. A value of "1"
#                            applies to the primary parent domain (d01) only. A value of "2" applies
#                            to domain 2, or the first nested domain. You can figure out the rest.
#
#         FILE TYPE          The FILE TYPE specifies the type of files to move.  Current options
#                            include:
#
#                                NETCDF    - All WRF netCDF formatted files (wrfout, auxhist1)
#                                WRFOUT    - Primary WRF netCDF output files (wrfout)
#                                AUXHIST   - Auxiliary WRF netCDF output files (auxhist1)
#                                GRIB      - GRIB 2 formatted files
#                                GEMPAK    - GEMPAK formatted files
#                                GRADS     - GRADS  files
#                                BUFR      - BUFR file sounding data
#                                BUFKIT    - BUFKIT formatted files processed from BUFR data
#                                GEMSND    - GEMPAK surface and sounding files created from BUFR data
#                                ACISND    - ASCII text sounding files created from BUFR data
#                                NETCDF    - WRF netCDF formatted files (WRF output)
#
#                            But wait, there is more!
#
#                            An optional ":S" may be added to the GRIB options, e.g., GRIB1:S, to
#                            indicate that you want the files sent individually rather than all at
#                            once following creation. This is only available when processing UEMS
#                            netCDF to GRIB format with emsupp, and you want to get the files to
#                            new location as soon as possible. This option is designed for anxious
#                            AWIPS users but may be used for other nefarious purposes as well.
#
#         KEY                KEY is the character string used by ems_post to determine which dataset
#                            to processes.  Currently your options are "wrfout" or "auxhist" for the
#                            primary and auxiliary processed files. If leave this field blank then
#                            both dataset types will be handled in the same way.
#
#         METHOD             Can be RSYNC, FTP, SFTP, SCP, or CP. If elect to use the copy (CP) command
#                            then the HOSTNAME will be ignored. If HOSTNAME is missing when using the
#                            RSYNC or SCP options, the local host is assumed. Finally, the FTP and SFTP
#                            methods are untested but assumed to work. I don't have a system running
#                            ftp anymore on which to test.
#
#         FREQ:START:STOP    Defines with which file time to start and stop the file transfer as well
#                            as the file time frequency, all in minutes and separated by a colon (:).
#                            Some effort is made to ensure appropriate start and stop times are used;
#                            however, it is up to you to make sure the frequency value is appropriate.
#                            In other words, If the dataset you wish to transfer is available every
#                            20 minutes, don't set FREQ to 15 or 27 minutes because you won't like
#                            the results and I will just snicker.
#
#                            So, if you choose FREQ = 60:120:360 (minutes), then hourly files will be
#                            sent beginning with the 2 hour file and ending at hour 6.  If you want
#                            all the files after 2 hours until the end of your dataset then leave
#                            STOP blank.
#
#         HOSTNAME           If this field is blank, then the copy (cp) command will be used to transfer
#                            files; otherwise, one of the other methods will be used. The HOSTNAME may
#                            be specified as the hostname or IP address of your target system and may
#                            also include the user (USER@HOSTNAME).
#
#                            If secure copy or ftp (SCP or SFTP) is selected, then you must have passwordless
#                            ssh configured between the local and target system. If you can manually sftp
#                            or ssh to the target machine then you should be good to go. If FTP is chosen,
#                            then you must have a valid .netrc file unless the target uses anonymous ftp,
#                            but who uses FTP anymore?
#
#         LOCATION           Defines the directory naming convention of the files on the target system.
#                            Note that you may use the place holders described in the location string
#                            that will be replaced with the appropriate values including:
#
#                            YYYY - 4-digit Year of initialization
#                              YY - 2-digit Year of initialization
#                              MM - 2-digit Month of initialization
#                              DD - 2-digit Day of initialization
#                              HH - 2-digit Hour (24-hour clock) of initialization
#                              MN - 2-digit Minute of initialization
#                              SS - 2-digit Second of initialization
#                              WD - 2-digit domain number
#                              RD - UEMS run domain directory (all lower case)
#                             KEY - Character string used to identify the WRF forecast file (wrfout, auxhist, etc.)
#                            CORE - 3-character core ID (NMM or ARW)
#                            DSET - dataset (gempak, grads, grib, etc.)
#
#     You may have multiple entries of a single method or multiple methods for any FILE TYPE. If you would
#     like to FTP and SCP GRIB files to 37 servers then go for it. Simply specify each entry below.
#
#     For example, an AWIPS entry might look like:
#
#        EXPORT = 0 | GRIB:S | wrfout  | SCP | 60 | user@lx1  | /data/incoming
#     or
#        EXPORT = 2 | GRIB   |         | FTP | 15:60:360 | lx2       | /data/incoming
#
#     The first example will send hourly (60 minutes) "wrfout" GRIB 2 files from ALL simulation domains
#     to machine "lx1" via secure copy individually (:S; as they are created).
#
#     The second example will send 15 minute domain 2 GRIB file to machine "lx2" via ftp after they have
#     been processed by emsupp beginning with the 1 hour time and ending at 6 hours.
#
#        EXPORT = | NETCDF  | auxhist1 |  CP  |  |  | /data/archive/YYYYMMDDCC/netcdf
#
#     The third example will copy all Auxiliary history files (netCDF format) from ALL domains to the
#     local directory /data/archive/YYYYMMDDCC/netcdf. The YYYYMMDDCC will be replaced with the
#     appropriate values from the model run.
#
#     A few of final comments:
#
#       1. The FTP and SFTP may fail if required to create a directory on the remote system
#          depending upon the permissions on the remote host.
#
#       2. You need to have passwordless ssh configured correctly between the machine running
#          ems_post and the remote server for SCP and SFTP to work correctly.
#
#       3. Commenting out or leaving EXPORT blank will result no transfer of files.
#
#       4. I'm so giddy, I can't contain myself.
#
#  Again, format of the EXPORT field is:
#
#  EXPORT = DOMAIN NUMBER | FILE TYPE | KEY | METHOD | FREQUENCY | [USER@]HOSTNAME | LOCATION
#
#EXPORT = 0 | netcdf |   | CP  |    |              | /data/export/YYYYMMDDCC/netcdf
#EXPORT = 0 | GRIB   |   | SCP | 60 | roz@moots    | /data/export/YYYYMMDDCC/grib2
#EXPORT = 1 | GEMPAK |   | CP  | 360|              | /data/export/YYYYMMDDCC/gempak
#EXPORT = 2 | BUFKIT |   | SCP | 180| roz@seven    | /data/export/YYYYMMDDCC/bufkit
