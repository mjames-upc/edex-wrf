# THE MAIN UEMS POST PROCESSING CONFIGURATION FILE
# ==============================================================================================
#
#  SO WHAT DOES THIS CONFIGURATION FILE DO FOR ME?
#
#    Below you will find parameters that control the post-processing of simulation
#    output files. Please review and modify as necessary.
#
#    Note that many of the parameters provided below may be overridden with user-
#    specified command line options. Please use the --help option or read the user
#    guide for additional details.
#
#  THE GENERAL, YET IMPORTANT STUFF
#
#    The parameters contained in this file designated as "MAX DOMAINS" may include multiple
#    comma separated values to specify different settings for nested domains.
#
#      FREQUENCY_WRFOUT = Primary Domain, Domain 2, Domain 3, ..., Domain N
#    Or
#      FREQUENCY_WRFOUT = 180, 60, 15, 5
#
#    The domain number to process is specified by passing the "--domain #" flag to ems_post,
#    with the default being the primary domain (domain 1).
#
#    Failure to include a value below for a requested domain, E.g.,
#
#       FREQUENCY_WRFOUT = 180, 60
#
#    when you are processing domain 3, ("--domain 3"), will result in the last value in
#    the parameter list being used (60), and you will like it.

#

#  GRIB (MAX DOMAINS)
#
#     Set GRIB to YES if you want to process the raw model output into GRIB 2 files using
#     the UEMS version of the Universal Post Processor (EMSUPP). It is recommended that
#     you set GRIB = Yes (default) unless you only want BUFR file processing or to export
#     the simulation output to other locations (post_export.conf).  If you don't want GRIB
#     file processing, then set GRIB = NO or pass the  "--nogrib" flag to ems_post.
#
#     The GRIB file processing will automatically be turned ON should you request one of
#     the file formats derived from GRIB, whether you like it or not. The exception to
#     this UEMS "rule of law" is when passing the "--noupp" flag, in which case stuff
#     gets turned on & off randomly.
#
#  DEFAULT: GRIB = Yes
#
GRIB = Yes


#  GEMPAK (MAX DOMAINS)
#
#     Were you aware that the UEMS package includes NAWIPS/GEMPAK?  Well it really doesn't
#     matter because you do now.  If you want to use NAWIPS for the display of simulation
#     output just set GEMPAK = YES and let the magic happen.  You may also want to
#     investigate the post_gempak.conf file for more configuration options.
#
#     Note that the NAWIPS/GEMPAK package provided by the UEMS includes executables that were
#     compiled for use with shared system libraries. This means that you may need to install
#     libraries that were excluded when the Linux OS was installed. To determine whether you
#     are missing a shared library, you can use the "uems/util/nawips/bin/libcheck" utility.
#
#     The GEMPAK value below may be overridden by passing the --[no]gempak flag.
#
#  DEFAULT: GEMPAK = No
#
GEMPAK = No


#  GRADS (MAX DOMAINS)
#
#     In addition to all the wonders provided by the UEMS, the package also includes
#     the Grid Analysis and Display System (GrADS).  If you wish to create GrADS
#     control and index files from the EMSUPP GRIB 2 files you've just minted, then
#     simply set GRADS = YES. You may also want to investigate post_grads.conf for
#     additional configuration options.
#
#     The GRADS value below may be overridden by passing the --[no]grads flag.
#
#  DEFAULT: GRADS = No
#
GRADS = No


#  BUFR (MAX DOMAINS)
#
#     In addition to GRIB 2 (gridded) files, the UEMS allows you to create BUFR sounding
#     profiles from your simulation output. The BUFR files may be processed further for use
#     with NAWIPS, BUFKIT, or another BUFR-compatible package.
#
#     If you choose to go BUFR (you'll never go back), then you will have to:
#
#       1. Specify any additional processing of the BUFR files in post_bufr.conf,
#
#       2. Figure out What to do with all the data you have created.
#
#     The answers to these, and other questions, should be located in the post_bufr.conf file.
#
#     The BUFR value below may be overridden by passing the --[no]bufr flag.
#
#  DEFAULT: BUFR = No
#
BUFR = No
